Al contempo, lo stesso blocco degli annunci era completamente sotto il controllo dell'app desktop: l'estensione e le sue impostazioni non avevano alcun ruolo a riguardo. Il problema era che, in alcuni casi, l'app e l'estensione si ostacolavano reciprocamente il lavoro. Alcuni siti web smettevano di essere protetti dal programma desktop e venivano sottoposti a backup solo dall'estensione, che ha meno possibilità. Pertanto, a partire dall'estensione del browser AdGuard v3.5, la modalità di integrazione è stata rimossa. Invece, è stato implementato il nuovo AdGuard Browser Assistant.

L'estensione bloccherà correttamente gli annunci su qualsiasi pagina nel tuo browser. Il blocco degli annunci si basa sui cosiddetti elenchi di filtraggio o, semplicemente, filtri. I filtri possono essere abilitati o disabilitati nelle impostazioni della tua estensione. Puoi personalizzare il blocco degli annunci, attivando i filtri specifici. "},{"title":"Filtri​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Panoramica delle funzionalità","url":"adguard-browser-extension/overview/#filters","content":"In sostanza, gli elenchi di filtraggio sono serie di regole scritte in un linguaggio speciale. Il tuo blocco degli annunci interpreta e implementa tali regole. Di conseguenza, smetti di vedere annunci sulle pagine web.  Tutti i filtri sono raggruppati a seconda del loro ruolo. Ad esempio, esistono categorie per i filtri di blocco degli annunci, di protezione della privacy, correlati ai social, etc. Puoi abilitare singoli filtri o l'intero gruppo, in una volta sola.  Filtri personalizzati​ Mentre le funzionalità degli altri gruppi di filtraggio sono più o meno prevedibili, esiste un gruppo, detto Personalizzati, che potrebbe sollevare ulteriori dubbi.  In questa scheda, puoi aggiungere filtri non presenti nell'estensione di default. Esistono numerosi filtri disponibili pubblicamente su Internet. Inoltre, puoi creare e aggiungere i tuoi filtri.

La seconda differenza è che le possibilità del blocco degli annunci basato sull'estensione sono rigorosamente limitate dalle linee guida del browser. Le estensioni del browser devono conformarsi alle politiche del browser, in cui il blocco degli annunci potrebbe essere limitato. Dunque, alcuni tipi di regole di filtraggio non sono supportate dalle estensioni. La funzionalità delle app per desktop non è limitata, quindi, hanno una migliore qualità di filtraggio. Mentre l'estensione di browser AdGuard è gratuita e facile da installare e contiene filtri per bloccare annunci e combattere le minacce online, le app complete sono più potenti e includono un elenco di funzionalità avanzate. Visualizza tutte le differenze nella seguente tabella comparativa.  1: entro le limitazioni del browser ed esclusivamente sul browser in cui è installata; 2: l'estensione non è in grado di rilevare le richieste da altre estensioni. Se un'estensione dannosa o di tracciamento invia una richiesta al proprio server per mostrarti annunci o tracciare la tua attività, l'estensione del browser AdGuard non sarà in grado di bloccare tale richiesta; 3 – non tutti i tipi di annunci e minacce possono essere bloccati dalle estensioni del browser per via di alcune limitazioni dello stesso. Alcuni elementi potrebbero arrivare sulla pagina e rallentare il processo di caricamento. Inoltre, a differenza del blocco di annunci basato su browser, l'app di AdGuard blocca gli annunci prima che siano caricati sul browser. Ciò, risparmia traffico e velocizza il caricamento della pagina.

Per proteggere il tuo intero dispositivo, scarica l'app di AdGuard AdGuard has two Android apps: AdGuard for Android and AdGuard Content Blocker. AdGuard for Android has a much wider range of functionality: it blocks ads, trackers, and annoyances in browsers and apps, uses filters as well as domain-level ad blocking, and supports user rules. AdGuard Content Blocker has a limited functionality. Full-fledged ad blockers can’t be introduced to Google Play due to the policy of the store. Google Play has banned &quot;apps that block or interfere with another app displaying ads&quot;. Thus, AdGuard for Android can be downloaded on AdGuard's official website only. As an alternative, Google offers to developers the Content blocking API. The API has strict limitations and is currently supported by two browsers: Yandex Browser and Samsung Internet browser. Many complex filtering rules supported in other AdGuard products don't work with this API. AdGuard Content Blocker was designed to fit the Google Play policy framework. Compared to other AdGuard products, AdGuard Content Blocker has less ad blocking capabilities: AdGuard Content Blocker works only in browsers that support the content blocking technology. Currently, there are two: Yandex Browser and Samsung Internet browser.Within the existing technology, the functionality of AdGuard Content Blocker is limited: for example it cannot block ads and trackers in apps or other browsers, has no filtering log and doesn't support filtering at the domain level. However, AdGuard Content Blocker has 35 filters that allow you to block ads, trackers, and annoyances in two supported browsers. You can also customize ad blocking by selecting appropriate language-specific filters or adding user rules. AdGuard Content Blocker is a free open-source software.

Thus, disabling Private DNS is impossible but we can make the system think that the upstream is not valid by blocking it with a $network rule.

Android derives traffic consumption judging on so-called Power Profile, which is given by every manufacturer: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/values.html Main part of Power Profile is a set of values in mAh which define battery consumption for every component of the device: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/values.html For example, from the table above: wifi.active= 31mA additional consumption in mAh caused by WiFi data exchange. radio.active= 100-300mA additional consumption in mAh caused by data exchange over Mobile network. cpu.active= 100-200mA additional consumption in mAh caused by CPU load. AdGuard by itself almost doesn't consume any traffic, so for the sake of evaluating power consumption let's get rid of 'Mobile/Wi-Fi packets' and stick to 'CPU'. Formula to calculate the consumption: &quot;CPU TIME (ms)&quot; X &quot;cpu.active&quot; / (60 60 1000) = &quot;POWER USE mAh&quot; Let's put real numbers into this formula. Let's take CPU total from the second screenshot and convert into milliseconds: 506000 A coefficient cpu.active for 2GHz will be roughly equal to 225mAh Final result: 506000 225 / (60 60 * 1000) = 31,625mAh "},{"title":"Conclusion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Battery and traffic consumption issues","url":"adguard-for-android/solving-problems/battery/#conclusion","content":"Real consumption is several times less than it is shown in Android statistics.

Network​ Filtraggio HTTPS​ To block ads and trackers on most websites and in most apps, AdGuard needs to filter their HTTPS traffic. Read more about HTTPS filtering Security certificates​ To manage encrypted traffic, AdGuard installs its CA certificate on your device. It's safe: the traffic is filtered locally and AdGuard verifies the security of the connection. On older versions of Android, the certificate is installed automatically. On Android 11 and later, you need to install it manually. Installation instructions The CA certificate in the user store is enough to filter HTTPS traffic in browsers and some apps. However, there are apps that only trust certificates from the system store. To filter HTTPS traffic there, you need to install AdGuard's CA certificate into the system store. Instructions HTTPS-filtered apps​ This section contains the list of apps for which AdGuard filters HTTPS traffic. Please note that the setting can be applied for all apps only if you have CA certificates both in the user store and in the system store. HTTPS-filtered websites​ This setting allows you to manage websites for which AdGuard should filter HTTPS traffic. HTTPS filtering allows AdGuard to filter the content of requests and responses, but we never collect or store this data. However, to increase security, we exclude websites that contain potentially sensitive information from HTTPS filtering. You can also add websites that you consider necessary to exclusions by selecting one of the modes: Exclude specific websites from HTTPS filteringFilter HTTPS traffic only on the websites added to exclusions By default, we also do not filter websites with Extended Validation (EV) certificates, such as financial websites. If needed, you can enable the Filter websites with EV certificates option. Proxy​ You can set up AdGuard to route all your device's traffic through your proxy server. How to set up an outbound proxy In this section, you can also set up a third-party VPN to work with AdGuard, if your VPN provider allows it. Under Apps operating through proxy, you can select apps that will route their traffic through your specified proxy. If you have Integration with AdGuard VPN enabled, this setting plays the role of AdGuard VPN's app exclusions: it allows you to specify apps to be routed through the AdGuard VPN tunnel. Routing mode​ This section allows you to select the traffic filtering method. Local VPN filters traffic through a locally created VPN. This is the most reliable mode. Due to Android restrictions, it is also the only system-wide traffic filtering method available on non-rooted devices. nota The Local VPN mode doesn't allow AdGuard to be used simultaneously with other VPNs. To use another VPN with AdGuard, you need to reconfigure it to work in proxy mode and set up an outbound proxy in AdGuard. For AdGuard VPN, this is done automatically with the help of the Integrated mode. Automatic proxy is an alternative traffic routing method that does not require the use of a VPN. One significant advantage is that it can be run in parallel with a VPN. This mode requires root access. Manual proxy involves setting up a proxy server on a specific port, which can then be configured in Wi-Fi settings. This mode requires root access for Android 10 and above. Filtri​ AdGuard blocks ads, trackers, and annoyances by applying rules from its filters. Most features from the Protection section are powered by AdGuard filters. If you enable Basic protection, it will automatically turn on the AdGuard Base filter and AdGuard Mobile Ads filter. And vice versa: if you turn off both filters, Basic protection will also be disabled.  Filters enabled by default are enough for normal AdGuard operation. However, if you want to customize ad blocking, you can use other AdGuard or third-party filters. To do this, select a category and enable the filters you'd like. To add a custom filter, tap Custom filters → Add custom filter and enter its URL or file path. nota If you activate too many filters, some websites may work incorrectly. Read more about filters Script utente​ Userscripts are mini-programs written in JavaScript that extend the functionality of one or more websites.

Blocking mode for adblock-style rules​ Here you can specify the response type for domains blocked by DNS rules based on adblock rule syntax (for instance, ||example.org^). Respond with REFUSEDRespond with NXDOMAINRespond with Custom IP address (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be specified here) Blocking mode for hosts rules​ Here you can specify the response type for domains blocked by DNS rules based on hosts rule syntax (for instance, &lt;ip&gt; &lt;domain&gt; 0.0.0.0 example.com). Respond with REFUSEDRespond with NXDOMAINRespond with Custom IP address (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be specified here) DNS request timeout​ Here you can specify the time in milliseconds that AdGuard will wait for the response from the selected DNS server before resorting to fallback. If you don’t fill in this field or enter an invalid value, the value of 5000 will be used. Blocked response TTL​ Here you can specify the TTL (time to live) value that will be returned in response to a blocked request. DNS cache size​ Here you can specify the maximum number of cached responses. Default value is 1000. ECH blocking​ If enabled, AdGuard strips Encrypted Client Hello parameters from DNS responses. Ignore unavailable outbound proxy​ If this setting is enabled, AdGuard will send DNS requests directly when the outbound proxy is unavailable. Try HTTP/3 for DNS-over-HTTPS upstreams​ If this setting is enabled, AdGuard will use HTTP/3 to speed up DNS query resolution for DoH upstreams. Otherwise, AdGuard will revert to its default behavior and use HTTP/2 to send all DNS requests for DNS-over-HTTPS. SERVFAIL failure response​ If this setting is enabled and all upstreams, including fallback ones, fail to respond, AdGuard will send a SERVFAIL response to the client. Use fallback for non-fallback domains​ If this setting is enabled, AdGuard will use fallback upstreams for all domains. Otherwise, fallback upstreams will only be used for fallback domains and search domains if the corresponding option is enabled. Validate DNS upstreams​ If this setting is enabled, AdGuard will test DNS upstreams before adding or updating custom DNS servers.

This is the very first packet which contains the name of the server you are connecting to. Encrypted Client Hello technology is supposed to solve this issue and encrypt that last bit of unencrypted information. To benefit from it, enable the Encrypted Client Hello option. It uses a local DNS proxy to look for the ECH configuration for the domain. If it is found, ClientHello packet will be encrypted. OCSP checking​ If this setting is enabled, AdGuard will perform asynchronous OCSP checks to get the revocation status of a website's SSL certificate. If an OCSP check is completed within the required timeout, AdGuard will immediately block the connection if the certificate is revoked or establish the connection if the certificate is valid. If the verification takes too long, AdGuard will allow the connection while continuing to check the certificate status in the background. If the certificate is revoked, current and future connections to the domain will be blocked. Redirect DNS-over-HTTPS requests​ If this setting is enabled, AdGuard will redirect DNS-over-HTTPS requests to the local DNS proxy in addition to plain DNS requests. We recommend disabling fallback upstreams and using only encrypted DNS servers to maintain privacy.

To see how it works, download the AdGuard app A number of users have encountered an issue where Samsung Pay does not work while AdGuard is running. This issue occurs almost exclusively on devices registered in South Korea. What is causing this issue? Sometimes Samsung Pay does not work on devices with VPN services running, and AdGuard is one of these apps. By default, AdGuard uses a local VPN to filter traffic, which can cause problems when using Samsung Pay. As a consequence, users had to disable AdGuard when making payments with Samsung Pay. This can be avoided with the Detect Samsung Pay feature. When this option is enabled, the AdGuard app is paused whenever the user opens the Samsung Pay app and resumes when the app is closed. nota This feature will work only if the Local VPN filtering mode is chosen in AdGuard settings. If another mode is being used, Samsung Pay will function without any interruptions. To enable Detect Samsung Pay, follow these steps: Go to Settings → General → Advanced→ Low-level settings. Scroll to Detect Samsung Pay and move the slider to the right. Tap Allow permissions and give AdGuard access to information about the use of other apps. We need it to collect statistics about the operation of Samsung Pay in order for the Detect Samsung Pay feature to work. After enabling this feature, when you switch from Samsung Pay to AdGuard, the following message will appear as shown in the screenshot. Alternatively, you can disable filtering for Samsung Pay in App management.

Background information In previous versions of the AdGuard Browser Extension (before v3.5), if you had it installed along with a desktop AdGuard for Mac, the extension took over the functions of Assistant, stopped filtering itself and relied on the app to do this. The extension and the app worked in conjunction but sometimes the integration would fail. Some websites would stop being protected by the desktop program and be backed up only by the less powerful extension. When using the Browser Assistant, all these problems don’t matter as there can be no conflicts in essence.

To understand how filtering works, get acquainted with our comprehensive article. But in essence, filter lists are sets of rules written in a special language, and your ad blocker is an interpreter of these rules who then implements them. As a result, you stop seeing ads on your web pages and life gets lots better. Some filter lists (AdGuard’s Base filter, Annoyances filter, EasyList, etc.) are pre-installed, while other specific ones, adapted to your preferences, can be downloaded additionally and added to your program. Aside from the more general and universally applicable filters (like Base filter), AdGuard provides an extensive quantity of filters for every occasion: filters aimed at tracking prevention (like Tracking Protection filter),language-specific ad filters that block content in a selected language,Social media filter that removes &quot;Like&quot; and &quot;Share&quot; buttons,Annoyances filter for cookie warnings, in-page pop-ups and others of the same ilk,and even a filter that unblocks some ads instead of blocking them — Filter for search ads and self-promotions. AdGuard filters are automatically updated. Our developers create them all based on user feedback received. You can always help other AdGuard users (and yourself, in perspective) by sending us reports right from the app's Assistant (it's really handy, we'll tell you more about the Assistant further on), or from the website.

What it does is protection from malicious and phishing websites. nota AdGuard is not an antivirus, but an entirely different program. It will show you a warning if you are about to go onto an infected domain, but it cannot stop you from downloading anything suspicious or help you deal with already existing viruses. Phishing is a very common web fraud aimed at stealing personal data (passwords, bank account details, etc.). It is carried out using fake web pages mimicking popular websites or real services, such as web stores or social networks. Many phishing websites have URLs that only differ from the real ones in just a few symbols to put you off your guard. If a user enters their details on such a website, they’ll definitely end up in the wrong hands. Browsing Security gives strong protection against such incidents. At the same time, the user’s personal information is not transferred anywhere, and AdGuard servers do not know which websites the user is visiting, because the security check is not performed via open web address (URL) but through hash prefixes (hash is a certain data structure that renders each address added to the base unambiguous). Some web pages are not malicious themselves, but they may contain elements built into their structure by other websites. Unlike browser plug-ins, Browsing Security module checks each object built into any web page, ensuring maximum protection. If you wish to help us in perfecting this module, you can check the lower box on the panel near the &quot;Help us with Browsing Security filters development&quot; phrase. This will enable your computer to send us pertinent info on fraudulent websites you might stumble upon while surfing the web — and our developers will make sure they end up locked at the bottom of your ban list.

"},{"title":"Estensioni​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-mac/overview/#estensioni","content":" Extensions are small programs that do exactly what their name implies — they extend functionality. And AdGuard uses several extensions of its own, also called userscripts, to broaden its functions range: 1. AdGuard Assistant (legacy version) This extension assists the user in changing basic AdGuard settings within the browser, without the need to open the app itself. Like Browser Assistant, legacy Assistant works with all macOS compatible browsers. Thanks to this little tool you can do several things without having to leave the browser: add a certain webpage to the &quot;do not block&quot; list, choose and block an especially annoying element on the page, report the website if it still manages to get ads through to you. nota This version of Assistant is legacy and there is no point in using it on new systems, since it has been replaced with the full-fledged Browser Assistant. But legacy Assistant might be of help if there is no Browser Assistant extension for your browser. 2. AdGuard Extra This extension is used to solve the more complicated ad blocking cases you might encounter. We would recommend you to always keep it switched on, unless you have a serious reason not to. 3. AdGuard Popup Blocker Prevents all these annoying popup windows from opening when you view webpages. Blocks popup ads on web pages. One of the important features of AdGuard for Mac is that the application can work as a cross-browser userscript manager. You can easily add any scripts you like and manage existing ones without having to switch browsers every time.

We do recommend to enable the first two ones: &quot;Automatically filter applications&quot; and &quot;Filter HTTPS protocol&quot;. Those are an important added precaution to better filter your web space. HTTP is the primary protocol for transmitting information over the Internet. Most data including ads is transferred via it, but it has one disadvantage — the connection is unencrypted. Thanks to the HTTPS filtering feature AdGuard has, not only HTTP traffic is filtered, but also HTTPS traffic (S stands for ‘secure’). There are also the options of &quot;Do not filter websites with EV certificates&quot; and &quot;Use AdGuard as an HTTP Proxy&quot;. Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates offer a stronger safety guarantee; owners of such websites have to pass a thorough and globally standardized identity verification process defined by EV guidelines. Which is the reason why some users trust websites with such certificates and prefer not to filter them. As for the second option — well, yes, in fact you can use AdGuard as a regular HTTP proxy server. All traffic coming through it will be filtered. This proxy will also be available on your local network, so you may use it for traffic filtering on other devices that are able to reach the proxy directly. To filter traffic on another device connected to proxy you will need to install an AdGuard root certificate there. After you configure proxy, open your browser and go to this page.

Compatibility with iCloud Private Relay​ Currently, AdGuard and iCloud Private Relay cannot work at the same time. AdGuard has no ability to block ads because iCloud Private Relay encrypts traffic before AdGuard can filter network connections. When iCloud Private Relay is active, any filtering (including local filtering) becomes impossible. Thus, AdGuard can't filter traffic or perform DNS filtering in Safari. That's why by default, AdGuard uses the &quot;default route&quot; which disables iCloud Private Relay. For a deeper understanding of this problem, read this article. Recommended solution We recommend using AdGuard together with a more traditional VPN service such as AdGuard VPN. Alternative solution You can prevent AdGuard from using the &quot;default route&quot; by disabling it. It can be done via Advanced Settings → network.extension.monterey.force.split.tunnel. Note that enabling this setting will cause the problems described above.  Compatibility with Protect Mail Activity​ Apple's Mail app now uses a proxy to hide a user's IP address when downloading images from emails. However, it won't work if there's an active VPN connection. As it treats AdGuard as a VPN, it won't preload images automatically. For a deeper understanding of this problem, read this article.

But to fix it for applications developed in Flutter, you need to wait for updates. If you use Flutter alongside AdGuard in &quot;Network Extension&quot; mode (or any other &quot;Transparent Proxy&quot;-type app) in Monterey or Big Sur, you will run into problems: projects won't open and Flutter will be effectively broken.

It needs to be said that this problem can't be solved by disabling connections monitoring in Little Snitch, because this action doesn't unload Little Snitch's extension from the system. We recommend to switch to Automatic Proxy filtering mode when running AdGuard alongside with Little Snitch on Big Sur, at least until Apple fixes the bug. "},{"title":"Compatibility with local proxies​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Compatibility issues with different macOS versions","url":"adguard-for-mac/solving-problems/big-sur-issues/#compatibility-with-local-proxies","content":"nota Now AdGuard can filter local proxies (mostly) without any problems. If you encounter any issues in OS versions 11.1+, or if you're using Big Sur 11.0, remove the local proxy from System settings and configure an upstream proxy in AdGuard by following the instruction below. To configure an upstream proxy in AdGuard for Mac in Big Sur: Open AdGuard's settings Preferences → Network → Outbound proxy.Choose HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4 or SOCKS5, depending on your proxy type.Fill in the fields: host is the IP address of your proxy server,port is the desired port number to be used by the proxy server,user and password are corresponding username and password of your proxy (if needed). Ignore either or both when not applicable. If you run into any problems, please contact our tech support at support@adguard.com. Example 1: Configuring an upstream Shadowsocks proxy​ Here's an example of how to configure an upstream proxy for Shadowsocks. First of all, you need a working server side for your proxy. Most likely, to set it up, you would use a JSON file like this (server and password values were chosen randomly here): { &quot;server&quot;:&quot;111.222.333.444&quot;, &quot;server_port&quot;:8388, &quot;local_port&quot;:1080, &quot;password&quot;:&quot;barfoo!&quot;, &quot;timeout&quot;:600, &quot;method&quot;:&quot;chacha20-ietf-poly1305&quot; }  consiglio You can find more information about how to get started on Shadowsocks website. Then you'd have to install Shadowsocks client on your Mac. Make sure that you select 'Manual Mode' or 'Auto Mode' in its settings! The configuration won't work if you select 'Global Mode' (or 'Auto Mode' in Big Sur versions prior to 11.1).  Now go to AdGuard menu → Advanced → Advanced Settings... and set the Value area of the upstream.proxy setting to socks5://localhost:1080. Notice that you need to use &quot;local_port&quot; value from the JSON file here. Because Shadowsocks uses SOCKS5, you also need to set the value of the upstream.proxy.socks5udp setting in AdGuard Advanced Settings to true to make AdGuard route UDP traffic to the proxy server. Example 2: Configuring an upstream Surge proxy​ In Big Sur v11.1+, there are no known conflicts between AdGuard and Surge proxy. If you are using an older version of Big Sur (prior to 11.1), check that System Proxy in the bottom right corner is disabled. Otherwise, Surge won't work with AdGuard. On the other hand, Enhanced Mode can be enabled without causing a conflict in any Big Sur version.  Now go to Preferences → Network → Outbound proxy and fill in the fields. For SOCKS5 proxy type: host: localhostport: 6153 For HTTP proxy type:host: localhostport: 6152 "},{"title":"Alternatives to using a Network Extension​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Compatibility issues with different macOS versions","url":"adguard-for-mac/solving-problems/big-sur-issues/#alternatives-to-using-a-network-extension","content":"It's impossible to foresee each and every possible problem that can pop up in Big Sur or Monterey, there are countless various hardware/software and settings configurations.

In the Ad Blocker module you can: enable automatic activation of language-specific filters,disable search ads and self-promotion blocking,activate pre-installed filters such as AdGuard Base filter,install filters from the list or add a custom filter by clicking the Add a filter button,make changes to existing rule groups using the Filter editor button,see all the requests sent by browsers and apps installed on your computer by clicking the Filtering log button. From there you can also block or unblock any request by creating a custom rule,compose a filter from your own rules written manually, imported or created with the AdGuard Assistant extension. Before you start manually writing your own rules read our detailed syntax guide.

Some web pages use cookies to mark the browser and save your personal settings, user preferences, or &quot;recognize&quot; you upon your next visit. Stealth Mode safeguards your personal information from such data and statistics gathering systems.  You can flexibly adjust the work of Stealth Mode: for instance, you can prohibit the website to receive the search request you used to find it on the Internet, automatically delete both third-party and website’s own cookies, and disable location sharing in your browser that can be used to track your whereabouts. To learn everything about Stealth Mode and its many options, read this article.

No, AdGuard for Windows is not an antivirus. It will neither stop the download of a virus when it's already started, nor delete the already existing ones. But it will warn you if you're about to proceed to a website whose domain has been added to our &quot;untrusted sites&quot; database, or to download a file from such website. You can find more information about how this module works in the dedicated article. In this module you can enable notifications to block requests to malicious and phishing sites,activate sound notifications,agree to submit anonymous security-related info to the AdGuard server to help us keep the malicious and phishing websites database up to date.  In case you want to learn more about Browsing Security, read this article. "},{"title":"DNS Protection​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-windows/overview/#dns-protection","content":"There are three significant reasons why you might want to explore the DNS protection settings. First, to avoid being tracked by your ISP. Every time you open a website, for example google.com, your browser sends a request to a DNS server to get the IP address of the website in return. Usually, the DNS server belongs to your ISP, which allows them to track your online activity. Second, to encrypt you DNS traffic. And the third one is to block content on DNS level.  In the DNS protection module of AdGuard for Windows you can select the DNS servers from known DNS providers, including AdGuard DNS that blocks ads and trackers, AdGuard DNS Family Protection that in addition blocks adult content, or AdGuard DNS Non-filtering that provides a secure and reliable connection, but doesn't filter anything. You can even add custom DNS servers. Also there is an option to add custom rules using DNS rule syntax. And if necessary, you can add DNS filters of your choice. "},{"title":"Parental Control​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-windows/overview/#parental-control","content":"There are several websites to which access should be restricted from a PC used by children. This task is accomplished by Parental Control.  The module checks the contents of web pages opened in the browser and filters those with content undesirable for children: images and texts for adults, crude language, violence, drug propaganda, etc. Parental Control settings are password-protected so that the child is not able to go round the restrictions. This module not only blocks directions to undesirable sites but can also delete the links that are inappropriate for children from the search results. In the Parental Control module you can enable the Safe search and manage the blocklist and the allowlist to customize how this option works. You can also check the Block executable files download box to prevent your child from downloading and installing software on the computer. There are two more options in the Parental Control module: you can select a specific Windows user to be protected by Parental Control and set a password to protect AdGuard settings from change.  "},{"title":"Browser Assistant​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-windows/overview/#browser-assistant","content":" From this tab you can easily proceed to install AdGuard Browser Assistant, which primary function is to manage filtering directly from the browser. We explained more about how to work with it and what to do if there is no Browser Assistant for your browser in the separate article. "},{"title":"Estensioni​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-windows/overview/#estensioni","content":"AdGuard can significantly broaden website functionality working as a user script manager. AdGuard Users can add their own scripts, as well as manage existing ones.  Automatically detect userscripts With this option enabled, AdGuard will automatically define browser queries to userscripts and suggest their installation. Otherwise, extensions can be downloaded and installed manually. The following extensions are installed with AdGuard:  AdGuard Assistant AdGuard Assistant is Legacy Assistant that you may use if the new Assistant is not available for your browser. The name of this extension is quite deliberate: it actually assists the user in changing basic AdGuard settings right in the browser, without the need to open the app itself. AdGuard Assistant works with all Microsoft Windows compatible browsers. In addition, the AdGuard Assistant icon will not be displayed on websites listed as exceptions by the user and on certain web pages where there is a risk of incorrect content display. AdGuard Extra This is a custom extension designed to fight the technique of re-inserting blocked ads — the so-called ad blocker circumvention/ad reinjection. Both are advanced anti-ad blocker methods that continue to rise in popularity among advertisers. AdGuard Extra is essentially a mini-program that changes the way pages work in such a way that it becomes much more difficult for sites to use the above-mentioned methods to bypass blockers. AdGuard Popup Blocker This extension prevents popup windows from opening when you view web pages. Some pop-ups are considered useful — they may contain settings for site administering or additional reference information demonstrated upon clicking a link. That is why you can turn off the Blocker if needed. This extension doesn’t work on websites added to the AdGuard exceptions list either. It is turned off by default, but you can turn it on in the application settings. You will find more detailed information about this extension in our Knowledge base. Web of Trust Web of Trust lets you see the reputation of each website based on its users’ opinions. The site is rated by a number of specific criteria: trust, security, etc. This extension is turned off by default, but you can turn it on in the application settings. Please, note that AdGuard is not the developer of this extension. "},{"title":"Network​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-windows/overview/#network","content":"The penultimate module is dedicated to network filtering, and here you will find additional network-related options. Two of them are enabled by default: Enable traffic filtering and Filter HTTPS protocol. These are important extra precautions to better filter your web space. Most websites are now using HTTPS, and the same applies to advertising. From many sites, like youtube.com, facebook.com and twitter.com, it is impossible to remove ads without HTTPS filtering. So keep the Filter HTTPS protocol feature enabled unless you have a strong reason not to.  In this module you can check the checkbox &quot;Use AdGuard as an HTTP proxy&quot; to use AdGuard as a regular HTTP proxy which will filter all traffic passing through it. You can also enable the Filter websites with EV certificates feature. Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates offer a stronger safety guarantee; owners of such websites have to pass a thorough and globally standardized identity verification process defined by EV guidelines. Which is the reason why some users trust websites with such certificates and prefer not to filter them. At last, there is a section with proxy settings. There you can specify which proxy server AdGuard should use to update filters, get new versions and so on. "},{"title":"AdGuard VPN​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-windows/overview/#adguard-vpn","content":"The last section is dedicated to AdGuard VPN — an ideal tool that provides security and anonymity each time you browse the Internet. You can download it by clicking the Download button or go to the AdGuard VPN website by clicking the Homepage button. How does AdGuard VPN work? Without going into technical details, we can say that VPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the user's computer or mobile device and a remote VPN server. In this way, data confidentiality is preserved, as well as the anonymity of the user, because a third-party observer sees the IP address of the VPN server and not the actual user's IP. What AdGuard VPN does: hides your real whereabouts and helps you stay anonymouschanges your IP address to protect your data from trackingencrypts your traffic to make it unreadable to third partieslets you configure where to use VPN and where not to (exclusions feature) To get more information about AdGuard VPN dive into the AdGuard VPN Knowledge Base.

Filters are literally lists of rules written in a special syntax. Ad blockers can understand this complex syntax. They interpret filtering rules and perform actions on web traffic based on what the rules tell them to do: block specific elements, alter web pages in certain ways, etc.  "},{"title":"Filter lists​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#filter-lists","content":"To better understand ad blocking, it's important to know the underlying principles of how filters work. Filtering rules that make up filters are not created automatically. They are developed by filter maintainers, including professionals and volunteers, who use browser developer consoles and other tools (such as the AdGuard's filtering log) to determine which rules will block a particular ad or tracker. This description of the process is very simplistic — some ads are particularly hard to block and require multiple rules, multiple iterations, and the use of complex syntax. And even when a rule finally gets added to a filter, it doesn't mean that it stays there forever. Ads change, ways to serve the same ads on the same websites change, and the filter rules have to change, too. Sometimes rules become obsolete, a new ad appears, or a new filtering rule is needed to block the same ad. Filters are often maintained by one person, but even for a team of maintainers, it's impossible to constantly monitor the entire web. That's why many ad blockers have tools to help users easily report any filter-related issues they encounter.  AdGuard users have access to a special web reporting tool. Thanks to user complaints, filter developers can focus on correcting their filter lists and not on scouring the Internet for new and old unblocked ads. Filters can do more than just block ads. There are filters that block tracking, social media widgets, and annoyances such as cookie notices. Different users may choose different combinations of filters to match their personal preferences. There are websites like filterlists.com that are dedicated to filter lists and have huge databases. We develop and maintain our own set of filter lists that can be used with AdGuard or other ad blockers. "},{"title":"Types of filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#types-of-filtering-rules","content":"There are many types of filtering rules that serve different purposes. Depending on the ad blocker you use, and especially on your OS, some types of rules may not be supported. "},{"title":"Basic filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#basic-filtering-rules","content":"To be displayed on a web page or in an app, the ad has to be loaded from a server first. To do so, the browser or the app needs to send a web request. The most basic way of preventing an ad from appearing on your screen is to block this request so it never reaches the server, and thus there's no reply. Basically, all AdGuard Ad Blocker products can block web requests according to the active filter rules. This method is very effective at stopping the ad, but it has some drawbacks. The most obvious one is: whatever place an ad was taking up will be left empty or occupied by an ad leftover. "},{"title":"Cosmetic filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#cosmetic-filtering-rules","content":"Every web page has a Document Object Model (DOM), an HTML document containing the structure and elements of this page. As ads are also page elements, they get recorded in the DOM. Ad blockers can remove parts of the DOM, while filtering rules help them understand which parts are ads and should be removed, and which parts should be left intact. This method allows you to avoid above-mentioned blank spaces and ad leftovers, as well as perform other more complicated tasks. "},{"title":"HTML filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#html-filtering-rules","content":"In most cases, it's enough to use the above-mentioned basic and cosmetic rules to filter ads. But when it is necessary to change the HTML code of the page itself before it is loaded, you need filtering rules for HTML content. These rules allow you to specify the HTML elements to be cut out before the browser even loads the page. These rules are quite complicated and require the ad blocker to be granted certain access rights, so not all platforms support them. Currently, these rules work only in the AdGuard Firefox add-on and in the AdGuard apps for Windows, Mac, and Android. info There are other types of filtering rules, but they require more advanced technical knowledge to understand how they work.

Our general stance here is very similar to the EasyList policy regarding self-promotion ads. According to our filter policy, we should not block these ads; however, we should not make an exception if such an ad gets blocked by some rule 'alongside' a regular ad. Partly, this is due to ethical reasons, but mostly because such ads are rarely too intrusive and are often useful for the visitor of the website (who is supposedly interested in this website's content).

This process includes tracking visited pages, time spent, interaction with website elements (e.g., clicks, form submissions), and other metrics. It allows website and application owners to better understand user behavior, optimize functionality, and adapt marketing strategies. Tracking is also used to monitor performance, usage patterns, and identify issues, providing developers with the necessary data to improve the stability and quality of the website or application. Even if the data obtained cannot reveal a person’s identity, such actions are still considered tracking. Tracker — software used on a website or in an application and designed to collect information about their operation and visitors’ actions. It tracks user interaction with the website or application, recording data about page views, time spent, clicks, form submissions, and other events. Its purpose is to provide website and application owners with a tool for analyzing user behavior, improving the user experience, and optimizing content and advertising. URL tracking parameter — a part of the address that is added to links by analytics systems or present in some links on web pages. When a request is made, this URL tracking parameter can be processed by the backend of an analytics system or website, which will extract information from it. For example, URL tracking parameters can transmit information about clicks or advertising campaigns. URL tracking parameters can also be used by fraud protection or bot detection systems.

Please read the technical explanation below. AdGuard is a network-level content blocker so it cannot simply add custom JavaScript and CSS to webpages like what browser extensions do. However, doing this is crucial for quality content blocking.In order to do it AdGuard injects a &quot;content script&quot; that looks like this: &lt;script src=&quot;https://local.adguard.org/.../content-script.js&quot;&gt;. This &quot;content script&quot; takes care of cosmetic filtering, hides or removes ad content from the web pages.Connections to the IP address of the local.adguard.org domain are intercepted by AdGuard on the network level and processed locally. This is why that domain has a &quot;static&quot; IP address that does not change for years. Why do we need to use a real IP address for that? We cannot use 127.0.0.1 as the browsers won't accept it.Using some IP address from the private subnets is possible, but this solution has two downsides.

This protocol is used to securely transmit valuable information like personal data, credit card details, etc. Using HTTPS is highly advantageous because encrypted traffic is protected against eavesdropping by a third party, and we can only welcome this. HTTPS acceptance has been growing in recent years, mainly because it is encouraged by Google and also due to the emergence of a free certificate authority Let’s Encrypt. The diagram below describes the difference between plain HTTP protocol and secure HTTPS protocol.  "},{"title":"What is a security certificate?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What is HTTPS filtering","url":"general/https-filtering/what-is-https-filtering/#what-is-a-security-certificate","content":"Simply put, HTTPS means data encryption. But there’s still a problem: how can you be sure that you’ve established an encrypted connection with the right website? That’s where security certificates come into play. A certificate serves as proof that the website is really what it tells you it is. If a website doesn’t have such a certificate, or if the certificate contains incorrect information, the browser will not allow you to establish a secure connection. It is important that the certificate a website uses is issued by a certificate authority (CA) trusted by your browser. Such a CA guarantees that the SSL certificate is, indeed, issued to the website’s owner.

When a browser attempts to connect to a server, AdGuard establishes two secure connections: one with the browser (or another app) and the other with the server. The browser must trust AdGuard and the connections it creates. For this purpose, AdGuard generates a special (and unique) root certificate and installs it into the system and, when it is required, into some browsers (e.g., Firefox). Thus, AdGuard can see what is happening inside the secure connection and do its job — block ads and trackers. For better understanding we depicted this process:  "},{"title":"Does my traffic remain encrypted and secure?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What is HTTPS filtering","url":"general/https-filtering/what-is-https-filtering/#does-my-traffic-remain-encrypted-and-secure","content":"Of course!

It is usually done by various kinds of antivirus software. The bad news is that 24 out of 26 tested antiviruses reduced, in various ways, the connection security level, while two-thirds created connections prone to hacking. The researchers came to a simple conclusion: the Internet security community should pay close attention to applications that filter secure connections. And the developers of such software must pay serious attention to the quality of filtering implementations. We would like to note that AdGuard was not tested in the above study. We ran estimates according to their set of tests, and at the time of testing, we could have received the maximum score — A*. However, this score is not perfect. During the study, the researchers identified some issues that were omitted in the final evaluation. Here at AdGuard, we fully agree with those conclusions. Moreover, we would like to be as open with users as possible and talk about the problems we are currently experiencing and the steps we are taking to improve the quality and security of the filtering mechanism. The list of these problems is sorted by priority. Most of the problems discovered in the above study are related to certificate validation mechanisms. This is what we want to focus on first. We are working on a separate certificate validation library. Moreover, we want to make it open source. A separate article lists all the known drawbacks of HTTPS filtering in AdGuard and our plans to fix them. HTTPS filtering issues on Android 7+​ Starting from Android 7, developers have to explicitly indicate that their apps trust user-installed certificates. Not everyone wants to, or bothers with it. What does it mean for AdGuard? AdGuard installs a user certificate to be able to filter HTTPS traffic. If an app doesn't trust this certificate, its HTTPS traffic will not be filtered. What to do? The first thing worth mentioning is that many apps (even modern ones) still trust user certificates. Nothing has changed in this regard. Almost all browsers also trust such certificates. There may be some exotic browsers that do not, but they are a rare exception to common practice. Finally, if your device is rooted, you can move the AdGuard certificate to the system storage. This way, you don't have to worry about any permissions a particular app may or may not have — HTTPS traffic will be filtered for modern apps just as well as for older ones. Please keep in mind that in this case, some additional security restrictions (e.g., HPKP or Expect-CT) apply to AdGuard.

Le licenze Standard erano valide soltanto per desktop e Mobile soltanto per smartphone e tablet. Le licenze Premium erano utilizzabili su 2-18 dispositivi. A seconda del numero di dispositivi selezionati all'acquisto, ti consentivano di attivare simultaneamente AdGuard su un numero equivalente di computer e dispositivi mobili: 2+2, 3+3, etc. Ad esempio, avresti potuto avere una licenza Premium per 2+2 dispositivi, quindi, la licenza sarebbe potuta essere installata su 2 computer e 2 telefoni/tablet.

Per tutti i tipi (Standard, Mobile, Premium), esistevano opzioni per una licenza Annuale o a Vita. A ottobre 2019, AdGuard è passato al nuovo sistema di licenze: da allora, le licenze sono ancora acquistabili per 1 anno o A Vita, ma le tipologie sono diventate: Personale (fino a 3 dispositivi) o Famiglia (fino a 9 dispositivi).

It contains the URL of the request source. When you navigate from one page to another, Referer saves the URL of the initial page. The server that hosts the destination web page often has software that parses Referer and extracts various pieces of information from it. Enabling the Hide Referer from third-parties option hides the current website from third-party sites by altering the HTTP header. You can also set an arbitrary value for Referer by entering it into the Custom Referer field. To use default Referer, leave the field blank. Note that to be able to filter traffic, AdGuard applications 'intercept' browser-to-server requests. Requests to ad, tracking, and phishing servers may be altered before sending them to the server or blocked completely. Same goes for the Hide Referer from third parties option: AdGuard intercepts HTTP(S) requests, in particular to remove or change the Referer header if this option is enabled. However, it happens only after these requests “leave” the browser. This means that if you monitor Referer inside the browser (for example, with the help of Chrome's Developer Tools), you will see the original Referer because the request hasn't reached AdGuard yet. You can use software like Fiddler to make sure that Referer gets altered correctly. On the opposite, due to the nature of all browser extensions, AdGuard Browser Extension works 'inside' the browser. It will alter the Referer right then and there, so Developer Tools will show the desired Referer for your requests.

Il loro utilizzo dipende dal numero di cose di cui parli. For instance, English words have two word forms when speaking about something in the singular, like 'one star', and in the plural — 'two stars'. It doesn’t matter if you say five, twenty six or even five hundred thirty two stars — the ending 's' will remain the same. Ma certe lingue possono contenere soltanto una o più forme plurali. A differenza dell'inglese, il polacco ha tre forme plurali dei sostantivi. One of them is used when speaking about something in the singular, another form is used in the plural but with numbers ending in 2–4, excluding 12–14, and the third form — for words with other numbers in front of them. Let’s take a look at this picture. Qui, puoi vedere il gruppo di numeri che determinano la forma di una parola, quando ci si trova di fronte.  Facciamo un piccolo parallelo tra l'inglese e il polacco, per una migliore comprensione:  La versione inglese: Gli equivalenti in polacco: 1. form — It takes one hour. 1. form — Zajmuje to godzinę. 2. form — It takes two hours. 2. form — Zajmuje to dwie godziny. 3. form — It takes five hours. 3. form — Zajmuje to pięć godzin.  Ora, è chiaro che il polacco 'godzinę' (ora) abbia tre forme differenti, mentre la parola in inglese cambia la sua forma con certi numeri soltanto due volte. A eccezione del polacco, esistono molte altre lingue dotate di tre forme plurali o più, come il russo, il serbo, lo slovacco, il ceco, etc. Ma non tutte seguono la stessa regola. That's why it's so important to know how many plurals your language has, and how to use them correctly.

Ecco alcune fonti di informazioni che puoi utilizzare. La Guida di Localizzazione contiene un ampio elenco di lingue. Il numero di forme plurali per le diverse lingue è mostrato come segue: 'nplurals=2', 'nplurals=4' e così via. Il numero dopo il segno Uguale '=' indica il numero di forme plurali della rispettiva lingua. Inoltre, puoi ottenere le informazioni sulle forme plurali nella Repository Locale di Dati Comuni Unicode (CLDR).

Crowdin suggerisce agli utenti di tradurre un certo numero di frasi con diverse forme plurali. Se la tua lingua fornisce soltanto una forma plurale, visualizzerai soltanto una frase da tradurre. Se prevede tre o più forme, Crowdin ti fornirà la stringa, divisa in altre due o tre stringhe da tradurre. Ad esempio:  Sei pregato di prestare attenzione traducendo e approvando tali stringhe. Se non hai idea di cosa significhi il campo &quot;Altro&quot;, incolla semplicemente la stessa forma del campo &quot;Molti&quot;. Le traduzioni dei campi &quot;Molti&quot; e &quot;Altro&quot; possono essere le stesse. "},{"title":"4. Stringhe con modelli separati dal simbolo della barra verticale​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Forme plurali","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/translate/plural-forms/#4type","content":"This is the most complicated type of AdGuard strings which is mostly used in the AdGuard Websites project. Pay close attention to a vertical bar sign between the sentences and %count% placeholders in original phrases — this will help you identify phrases where translations require the use of plural forms.  Ora, immaginiamo di trovarci di fronte a una stringa del genere: Standard license for %count% computer | Standard license for %count% computers. Cosa dovresti sapere per tradurlo correttamente? Le frasi divise da un simbolo della barra verticale sono dette &quot;modelli&quot;, poiché servono effettivamente da modelli per frasi con numeri diversi. Tornando all'esempio, poiché la lingua inglese include soltanto due forme, dovrebbero esser rispettivamente presenti due modelli: Standard license for *%count%* computer | Standard license for *%count%* computers where template 1 is Standard license for %count% computer, and template 2 is Standard license for %count% computers Un'altra cosa importante a cui dovresti prestare attenzione sono i segnaposto %count% che, solitamente, si trovano prima delle parole che definiscono. Invece di %count%, qui, appariranno vari numeri, a seconda di quali modelli sono scelti. In una situazione con un'altra lingua avente, per esempio, tre forme plurali, dovrebbero essere presenti tre modelli separati da due simboli della barra verticale. Ad esempio, traducendo la suddetta frase in slovacco, che secondo la regola della Guida di Localizzazione contiene tre forme della parola, la traduzione corretta sarà la seguente: **Štandartná licencia pre *%count%* počítač | Štandartná licencia pre *%count%* počítače | Štandartná licencia pre *%count%* počítačov**  In questo caso, vediamo tre modelli contenenti tre forme della parola &quot;počítač&quot; (computer) in Slovacco. Se ignoriamo una di queste forme e utilizziamo soltanto due modelli per lo slovacco, invece di tre, il sistema non riuscirà a prelevare un modello appropriato per certi numeri e, di conseguenza, avremo errori grammaticali nelle frasi, come in inglese: Standard license for 5 computer. Always use as many forms as there are in your language, even when the word itself has fewer word forms. Ad esempio, la parola serba 'računar' (computer) prevede soltanto due forme. Ma in serbo esistono 3 forme plurali.  Pertanto, la traduzione dall'inglese al serbo dovrebbe essere: **Standardna licenca za *%count%* računar | Standardna licenca za *%count%* računara | Standardna licenca za *%count%* računara** Sebbene sia ovvio che gli ultimi due modelli non presentino differenze, è molto importante seguire la regola: Il numero di modelli dovrebbe riflettere il numero di forme plurali della rispettiva lingua! (tipicamente, per questo tipo di stringhe contenenti plurali). "},{"title":"Riepilogo breve​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Forme plurali","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/translate/plural-forms/#summury","content":"Traducendo i progetti di AdGuard, presta particolare attenzione alle frasi che richiedono l'utilizzo di forme plurali. Sebbene i primi tre tipi di tali stringhe siano più o meno facili da tradurre, il quarto richiede una maggiore attenzione. E ancora: se ti imbatti in una frase originale con due elementi importanti: il simbolo della barra verticale e i segnaposto %count%, sei pregato di procedere come segue: Fai riferimento alla regola del plurale della lingua verso cui traduci; The number of your templates should be consistent with the number of plural forms your language includes, even in cases some words have fewer forms themselves. Two plural forms — two templates in translations; five plural forms — five templates, etc. Non dimenticarti di utilizzare un simbolo barra verticale tra i modelli, come rappresentato nelle stringhe originali; Non tradurre, riempire o eliminare i segnaposto %count%.

Sub-requests Basic rules for blocking requests are applied only to sub-requests. That means they will not block the loading of the page unless it is explicitly specified with a $document modifier.

With this character, you do not have to specify a particular protocol and subdomain in address mask. It means that || stands for http://*., https://*., ws://*., wss://*. at once.^ — a separator character mark. Separator character is any character, but a letter, a digit, or one of the following: _ - . %. In this example separator characters are shown in bold: http://example.com/?t=1&amp;t2=t3. The end of the address is also accepted as separator.| — a pointer to the beginning or the end of address. The value depends on the character placement in the mask. For example, a rule swf| corresponds to http://example.com/annoyingflash.swf , but not to http://example.com/swf/index.html. |http://example.org corresponds to http://example.org, but not to http://domain.com?url=http://example.org. nota |, ||, ^ can only be used with rules that have a URL pattern.

This might be not too important on Windows and Mac, but this is very important on mobile devices where some of the filtering rules must be app-specific. Android — use the app package name, e.g. org.example.app.Windows — use the process name, e.g. chrome.exe.Mac — use the bundle ID or the process name, e.g. com.google.Chrome. For Mac, you can find out the bundle ID or the process name of the app by viewing the respective request details in the Filtering log. Examples ||baddomain.com^$app=org.example.app — a rule to block requests that match the specified mask and are sent from the org.example.app Android app.||baddomain.com^$app=org.example.app1|org.example.app2 — the same rule but it works for both org.example.app1 and org.example.app2 apps. If you want the rule not to be applied to certain apps, start the app name with the ~ sign. ||baddomain.com^$app=~org.example.app — a rule to block requests that match the specified mask and are sent from any app except for the org.example.app.||baddomain.com^$app=~org.example.app1|~org.example.app2 — same as above, but now two apps are excluded: org.example.app1 and org.example.app2. Restrictions Apps in the modifier value cannot have a wildcard, e.g. $app=com.*.music. Rules with such modifier are considered invalid. Compatibility Only AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android are technically capable of using rules with $app modifier.On Windows the process name is case-insensitive starting with AdGuard for Windows versions that have CoreLibs v1.12 under the hood. $denyallow​ $denyallow modifier allows to avoid creating additional rules when it is needed to disable a certain rule for specific domains. $denyallow matches only target domains and not referrer domains. Adding this modifier to a rule is equivalent to excluding the domains by the rule's matching pattern or to adding the corresponding exclusion rules. To add multiple domains to one rule, use the | character as a separator. Examples This rule: *$script,domain=a.com|b.com,denyallow=x.com|y.com  is equivalent to this one: /^(?!.*(x.com|y.com)).*$/$script,domain=a.com|b.com  or to the combination of these three: *$script,domain=a.com|b.com @@||x.com$script,domain=a.com|b.com @@||y.com$script,domain=a.com|b.com  Restrictions The rule's matching pattern cannot target any specific domains, e.g. it cannot start with ||.Domains in the modifier value cannot be negated, e.g. $denyallow=~x.com, or have a wildcard TLD, e.g. $denyallow=x.*. The rules which violate these restrictions are considered invalid. Compatibility Rules with $denyallow modifier are not supported by AdGuard for iOS, Safari, and AdGuard Content Blocker. $domain​ $domain limits the rule scope to requests made from the specified domains and their subdomains (as indicated by the Referer HTTP header). Syntax The modifier is a list of one or more expressions separated by the | symbol, each of which is matched against a domain in a particular way depending on its type (see below). domains = [&quot;~&quot;] entry_0 [&quot;|&quot; [&quot;~&quot;] entry_1 [&quot;|&quot; [&quot;~&quot;]entry_2 [&quot;|&quot; ... [&quot;|&quot; [&quot;~&quot;]entry_N]]]] entry_i = ( regular_domain / any_tld_domain / regexp )  regular_domain — a regular domain name (domain.com). Corresponds the specified domain and its subdomains. It is matched lexicographically.any_tld_domain — a domain name ending with a wildcard character as a public suffix, e.g. for example.* it is co.uk in example.co.uk. Corresponds to the specified domain and its subdomains with any public suffix. It is matched lexicographically.regexp — a regular expression, starts and ends with /. The pattern works the same way as in the basic URL rules, but the characters /, $, and | must be escaped with \\. info Rules with $domain modifier as regular_domain or any_tld_domain are supported by all AdGuard products. Examples Just $domain: ||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org blocks requests that match the specified mask, and are sent from domain example.org or its subdomains.||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|example.com — the same rule, but it works for both example.org and example.com. If you want the rule not to be applied to certain domains, start a domain name with ~ sign. $domain and negation ~: ||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org blocks requests that match the specified mask and are sent from the example.org domain or its subdomains.||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|example.com — the same rule, but it works for both example.org and example.com.||baddomain.com^$domain=~example.org blocks requests matching the pattern sent from any domain except example.org and its subdomains.||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|~foo.example.org blocks requests sent from example.org and its subdomains, except the subdomain foo.example.org.||baddomain.com^$domain=/(^\\|.+\\.)example\\.(com\\|org)\\$/ blocks requests sent from example.org and example.com domains and all their subdomains.||baddomain.com^$domain=~a.com|~b.*|~/(^\\|.+\\.)c\\.(com\\|org)\\$/ blocks requests sent from any domains, except a.com, b with any public suffix (b.com, b.co.uk, etc.), c.com, c.org, and their subdomains. $domain modifier matching target domain: In some cases the $domain modifier can match not only the referrer domain, but also the target domain. This happens when all the following conditions are met: The request has the document content typeThe rule pattern does not match any particular domainsThe rule pattern does not contain regular expressionsThe $domain modifier contains only excluded domains, e.g. $domain=~example.org|~example.com The following predicate should be satisfied to perform a target domain matching: 1 AND ((2 AND 3) OR 4)  That is, if the modifier $domain contains only excluded domains, then the rule does not need to meet the second and third conditions to match the target domain against the modifier $domain. If some of the conditions above are not met but the rule contains $cookie or $csp modifier, the target domain will still be matched. If the referrer matches a rule with $domain that explicitly excludes the referrer domain, then the rule will not be applied even if the target domain also matches the rule. This affects rules with $cookie and $csp modifiers, too. Examples *$cookie,domain=example.org|example.com will block cookies for all requests to and from example.org and example.com.*$document,domain=example.org|example.com will block all requests to and from example.org and example.com. In the following examples it is implied that requests are sent from http://example.org/page (the referrer) and the target URL is http://targetdomain.com/page. page$domain=example.org will be matched, as it matches the referrer domain.page$domain=targetdomain.com will be matched, as it matches the target domain and satisfies all requirements mentioned above.||*page$domain=targetdomain.com will not be matched, as the pattern ||*page may match specific domains, e.g. example.page.||*page$domain=targetdomain.com,cookie will be matched because the rule contains $cookie modifier despite the pattern ||*page may match specific domains./banner\\d+/$domain=targetdomain.com will not be matched as it contains a regular expression.page$domain=targetdomain.com|~example.org will not be matched because the referrer domain is explicitly excluded. $domain modifier limitations​ Restrictions Safari does not support the simultaneous use of allowed and disallowed domains, so rules like ||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|~foo.example.org will not work in AdGuard for iOS and AdGuard for Safari. Compatibility Rules with regular expressions in the $domain modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs v1.11 or later. In AdGuard for Windows, Mac and Android running CoreLibs v1.12 or later the $domain modifier can be alternatively spelled as $from. $header​ The $header modifier allows matching the HTTP response having a specific header with (optionally) a specific value. Syntax $header &quot;=&quot; h_name [&quot;:&quot; h_value] h_value = string / regexp  where: h_name — required, an HTTP header name. It is matched case-insesitively.h_value — optional, an HTTP header value matching expression, it may be one of the following: string — a sequence of characters. It is matched against the header value lexicographically;regexp — a regular expression, starts and ends with /. The pattern works the same way as in the basic URL rules, but the characters /, $ and , must be escaped with \\. The modifier part, &quot;:&quot; h_value, may be omitted. In that case, the modifier matches the header name only. Examples ||example.com^$header=set-cookie:foo blocks requests whose responses have the Set-Cookie header with the value matching foo literally.||example.com^$header=set-cookie blocks requests whose responses have the Set-Cookie header with any value.@@||example.com^$header=set-cookie:/foo\\, bar\\$/ unblocks requests whose responses have the Set-Cookie header with value matching the foo, bar$ regular expression.@@||example.com^$header=set-cookie unblocks requests whose responses have a Set-Cookie header with any value. Compatibility Rules with the $header modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android with CoreLibs v1.11 or later. $important​ The $important modifier applied to a rule increases its priority over rules without the identical modifier. Even over basic exception rules. Go to rules priorities for more details. Examples ! blocking rule will block all requests despite of the exception rule ||example.org^$important @@||example.org^  ! if the exception rule also has `$important` modifier, it will prevail and requests won't be blocked ||example.org^$important @@||example.org^$important  $match-case​ This modifier defines a rule which applies only to addresses that match the case. Default rules are case-insensitive. Examples */BannerAd.gif$match-case — this rule will block http://example.com/BannerAd.gif, but not http://example.com/bannerad.gif. Compatibility Rules with the $match-case are supported by AdGuard for iOS and AdGuard for Safari, running SafariConverterLib v2.0.43 or later. All other products already support this modifier. $method​ This modifier limits the rule scope to requests that use the specified set of HTTP methods. Negated methods are allowed. The methods must be specified in all lowercase characters, but are matched case-insensitively. To add multiple methods to one rule, use the vertical bar | as a separator. Examples ||evil.com^$method=get|head blocks only GET and HEAD requests to evil.com.||evil.com^$method=~post|~put blocks any requests to evil.com except POST or PUT.@@||evil.com$method=get unblocks only GET requests to evil.com.@@||evil.com$method=~post unblocks any requests to evil.com except POST. Restrictions Rules with mixed negated and not negated values are considered invalid. So, for example, the rule ||evil.com^$method=get|~head will be rejected. Compatibility Rules with $method modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android with CoreLibs v1.12 or later and AdGuard Browser Extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge with TSUrlFilter v2.1.1 or later. $popup​ AdGuard will try to close the browser tab with any address that matches a blocking rule with this modifier. Please note that not all the tabs can be closed. Examples ||domain.com^$popup — if you try to go to http://domain.com/ from any page in the browser, a new tab in which specified site has to be opened will be closed by this rule. Compatibility $popup modifier works best in AdGuard Browser Extension.In AdGuard for Safari and iOS, $popup rules simply block the page right away.In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, $popup modifier may not detect a popup in some cases and it will not be blocked. $popup modifier applies the document content type with a special flag which is passed to a blocking page. Blocking page itself can do some checks and close the window if it is really a popup. Otherwise, page should be loaded. It can be combined with other request type modifiers, such as $third-party and $important.Rules with $popup modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $third-party​ A restriction of third-party and own requests. A third-party request is a request from a different domain. For example, a request to example.org from domain.com is a third-party request. nota To be considered as such, a third-party request should meet one of the following conditions: Its referrer is not a subdomain of the target domain or vice versa. For example, a request to subdomain.example.org from example.org is not a third-party requestIts Sec-Fetch-Site header is set to cross-site Examples $third-party: ||domain.com^$third-party — this rule applies to all domains, except domain.com and its subdomains. An example of a third-party request: http://example.org/banner.jpg. If there is a $~third-party modifier, the rule is only applied to the requests that are not from third parties. Which means, they have to be sent from the same domain. $~third-party: ||domain.com$~third-party — this rule is applied exclusively to domain.com. Example of a non third-party request: http://domain.com/icon.ico. nota You may use a shorter name (alias) instead of using the full modifier name: $3p. $to​ $to limits the rule scope to requests made to the specified domains and their subdomains. To add multiple domains to one rule, use the | character as a separator. Examples /ads$to=evil.com|evil.org blocks any request to evil.com or evil.org and their subdomains with a path matching /ads./ads$to=~not.evil.com|evil.com blocks any request to evil.com and its subdomains, with a path matching /ads, except requests to not.evil.com and its subdomains./ads$to=~good.com|~good.org blocks any request with a path matching /ads, except requests to good.com or good.org and their subdomains. Restrictions $denyallow can not be used together with $to. It can be expressed with inverted $to: $denyallow=a.com|b.com is equivalent to $to=~a.com|~b.com. Compatibility Rules with the $to modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android with CoreLibs v1.12 or later and AdGuard Browser Extension with TSUrlFilter v2.1.3 or later.

These modifiers can also be combined to cover, for example, both images and scripts. Compatibility There is a big difference in how AdGuard determines the content type on different platforms. For AdGuard Browser Extension, content type for every request is provided by the browser. AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android use the following method: first, the apps try to determine the type of the request by the Sec-Fetch-Dest request header or by the filename extension. If the request is not blocked at this stage, the type will be determined using the Content-Type header at the beginning of the server response. Examples of content-type modifiers ||example.org^$image — corresponds to all images from example.org.||example.org^$script,stylesheet — corresponds to all the scripts and styles from example.org.||example.org^$~image,~script,~stylesheet — corresponds to all requests to example.org except for the images, scripts and styles.

It does not match iframes, there is a $subdocument modifier for these. By default, AdGuard does not block the requests that are loaded in the browser tab (e.g. &quot;main frame bypass&quot;). The idea is not to prevent pages from loading as the user clearly indicated that they want this page to be loaded. However, if the $document modifier is specified explicitly, AdGuard does not use that logic and prevents the page load. Instead, it responds with a &quot;blocking page&quot;. If this modifier is used with an exclusion rule (@@), it completely disables blocking on corresponding pages. It is equivalent to using $elemhide, $content, $urlblock, $jsinject, $extension modifiers simultaneously. Examples @@||example.com^$document completely disables filtering on all pages at example.com and all subdomains. ||example.com^$document blocks HTML document request to example.com with a blocking page. ||example.com^$document,redirect=noopframe redirects HTML document request to example.com to an empty html document. ||example.com^$document,removeparam=test removes test query parameter from HTML document request to example.com. ||example.com^$document,replace=/test1/test2/ replaces test1 with test2 in HTML document request to example.com. nota You may use a shorter name (alias) instead of using the full modifier name: $doc. $font​ The rule corresponds to requests for fonts, e.g. .woff filename extension. $image​ The rule corresponds to images requests. $media​ The rule corresponds to requests for media files — music and video, e.g. .mp4 files. $object​ The rule corresponds to browser plugins resources, e.g. Java or Flash. $other​ The rule applies to requests for which the type has not been determined or does not match the types listed above. $ping​ The rule corresponds to requests caused by either navigator.sendBeacon() or the ping attribute on links. Compatibility AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android often cannot accurately detect navigator.sendBeacon(). Using $ping is not recommended in the filter lists that are supposed to be used by CoreLibs-based AdGuard products. Rules with $ping modifier are not supported by AdGuard for Safari and iOS. $script​ The rule corresponds to script requests, e.g. javascript, vbscript. $stylesheet​ The rule corresponds to CSS files requests. nota You may use a shorter name (alias) instead of using the full modifier name: $css. $subdocument​ The rule corresponds to requests for built-in pages — HTML tags frame and iframe. Examples ||example.com^$subdocument blocks built-in page requests (frame and iframe) to example.com and all its subdomains anywhere.||example.com^$subdocument,domain=domain.com blocks built-in page requests (frame и iframe) to example.com (and its subdomains) from domain.com and all its subdomains. nota You may use a shorter name (alias) instead of using the full modifier name: $frame. Compatibility In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android subdocuments are being detected by the Sec-Fetch-Dest header if it is present. Otherwise, some main pages may be treated as subdocuments. Rules with $subdocument modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $websocket​ The rule applies only to WebSocket connections. Compatibility $websocket modifier is supported in all AdGuard products except AdGuard Content Blocker. As for AdGuard for Safari and AdGuard for iOS, it's supported on devices with macOS Monterey (version 12) and iOS 16 or higher. $xmlhttprequest​ The rule applies only to ajax requests (requests sent via javascript object XMLHttpRequest). nota You may use a shorter name (alias) instead of using the full modifier name: $xhr. Compatibility AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android when filtering older browsers cannot accurately detect this type and sometimes detects it as $other or $script. They can only reliably detect this content type when filtering modern browsers that support Fetch metadata request headers. $object-subrequest (removed)​ Removal notice $object-subrequest modifier is removed and is no longer supported. Rules with it are considered as invalid. The rule corresponds to requests by browser plugins (it is usually Flash). $webrtc (removed)​ Removal notice This modifier is removed and is no longer supported. Rules with it are considered as invalid. If you need to suppress WebRTC, consider using the nowebrtc scriptlet. The rule applies only to WebRTC connections.

The modifier can contain any number of userscript names or none. In the latter case the modifier disables all the userscripts. Userscript names usually contain spaces or other special characters, which is why you should enclose the name in quotes. Both single (') and double (&quot;) ASCII quotes are supported. Multiple userscript names should be separated with a pipe (|). However, if a userscript name is a single word without any special characters, it can be used without quotes.

Compatibility Rules with $all modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $badfilter​ The rules with the $badfilter modifier disable other basic rules to which they refer. It means that the text of the disabled rule should match the text of the $badfilter rule (without the $badfilter modifier). Examples ||example.com$badfilter disables ||example.com||example.com$image,badfilter disables ||example.com$image@@||example.com$badfilter disables @@||example.com||example.com$domain=domain.com,badfilter disables ||example.com$domain=domain.com Rules with $badfilter modifier can disable other basic rules for specific domains if they fulfill the following conditions: The rule has a $domain modifierThe rule does not have a negated domain ~ in $domain modifier value In that case, the $badfilter rule will disable the corresponding rule for domains specified in both the $badfilter and basic rules.

Instead of blocking a request, this modifier makes AdGuard suppress or modify the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. Multiple rules matching a single request In case if multiple $cookie rules match a single request, we will apply each of them one by one. Syntax $cookie [= name[; maxAge = seconds [; sameSite = strategy ]]]  where: name — optional, string or regular expression to match cookie name.seconds — number of seconds for current time to offset the expiration date of cookie.strategy — string for Same-Site strategy to make cookie use. For example, ||example.org^$cookie=NAME;maxAge=3600;sameSite=lax  every time AdGuard encounters a cookie called NAME in a request to example.org, it will do the following: Set its expiration date to current time plus 3600 secondsMakes the cookie use Same-Site &quot;lax&quot; strategy. Escaping special characters If regular expression name is used for matching, two characters must be escaped: comma , and dollar sign $. Use backslash \\ escape each of them. For example, escaped comma looks like this: \\,. Examples ||example.org^$cookie blocks all cookies set by example.org; this is an equivalent to setting maxAge=0$cookie=__cfduid blocks CloudFlare cookie everywhere$cookie=/__utm[a-z]/ blocks Google Analytics cookies everywhere||facebook.com^$third-party,cookie=c_user prevents Facebook from tracking you even if you are logged in There are two methods to deactivate $cookie rules: the primary method involves using an exception marked with @@ — @@||example.org^$cookie. The alternative method employs a $urlblock exception (also included under the $document exception alias — $elemhide,jsinject,content,urlblock,extension). Here's how it works: @@||example.org^$cookie unblocks all cookies set by example.org@@||example.org^$urlblock unblocks all cookies set by example.org and disables blocking of all requests sent from example.org@@||example.org^$cookie=concept unblocks a single cookie named concept@@||example.org^$cookie=/^_ga_/ unblocks every cookie that matches the regular expression Restrictions $cookie rules support three types of modifiers: $domain, $~domain, $important, $third-party, and $~third-party. Compatibility Rules with $cookie modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS, and AdGuard for Safari. $csp​ This modifier completely changes the rule behavior. If it is applied to a rule, the rule will not block the matching request. Response headers will be modified instead. info In order to use this type of rules, it is required to have the basic understanding of the Content Security Policy security layer. For the requests matching a $csp rule, we will strengthen response security policy by enhancing the content security policy, similar to the content security policy of the $csp modifier contents. $csp rules are applied independently from any other rule type. Only document-level exceptions can influence it (see the examples section), but no other basic rules. Multiple rules matching a single request In case if multiple $csp rules match a single request, we will apply each of them. Syntax $csp value syntax is similar to the Content Security Policy header syntax. $csp value can be empty in the case of exception rules. See examples section below. Examples ||example.org^$csp=frame-src 'none' blocks all frames on example.org and its subdomains.@@||example.org/page/*$csp=frame-src 'none' disables all rules with the $csp modifier exactly matching frame-src 'none' on all the pages matching the rule pattern. For instance, the rule above.@@||example.org/page/*$csp disables all the $csp rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern.||example.org^$csp=script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: disables inline scripts on all the pages matching the rule pattern.@@||example.org^$document or @@||example.org^$urlblock disables all the $csp rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern. Restrictions There are a few characters forbidden in the $csp value: ,, $.$csp rules support limited list of modifiers: $domain, $important, $subdocument.Rules with report-* directives are considered invalid. Compatibility Rules with $csp modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and AdGuard for Safari. $hls​ $hls rules modify the response of a matching request. They are intended as a convenient way to remove segments from HLS playlists (RFC 8216). nota The word &quot;segment&quot; in this document means either a &quot;Media Segment&quot; or a &quot;playlist&quot; as part of a &quot;Master Playlist&quot;: $hls rules do not distinguish between a &quot;Master Playlist&quot; and a &quot;Media Playlist&quot;. Syntax ||example.org^$hls=urlpattern removes segments whose URL matches the URL pattern urlpattern. The pattern works just like the one in basic URL rules, however, the characters /, $ and , must be escaped with \\ inside urlpattern.||example.org^$hls=/regexp/options removes segments where the URL or one of the tags (for certain options, if present) is matched by the regular expression regexp. Available options are: t — instead of testing the segment's URL, test each of the segment's tags against the regular expression. A segment with a matching tag is removed;i — make the regular expression case-insensitive. The characters /, $ and , must be escaped with \\ inside regexp. Exceptions Basic URL exceptions shall not disable rules with $hls modifier. They can be disabled as described below: @@||example.org^$hls disables all $hls rules for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$hls=text disables all $hls rules with the value of the $hls modifier equal to text for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^. consiglio $hls rules can also be disabled by $document, $content and $urlblock exception rules. nota When multiple $hls rules match the same request, their effect is cumulative. Examples ||example.org^$hls=\\/videoplayback^?*&amp;source=dclk_video_ads removes all segments with the matching URL.||example.org^$hls=/\\/videoplayback\\/?\\?.*\\&amp;source=dclk_video_ads/i achieves more or less the same with a regular expression instead of a URL pattern.||example.org^$hls=/#UPLYNK-SEGMENT:.*\\,ad/t removes all segments which have the matching tag. Anatomy of an HLS playlist A quick summary of the specification: An HLS playlist is a collection of text linesA line may be empty, a comment (starts with #), a tag (also starts with #, can only be recognized by name) or a URLA URL line is called a &quot;segment&quot;Tags may apply to a single segment, i.e. the first URL line after the tag, to all segments following the tag and until the tag with the same name, or to the whole playlist Some points specific to the operation of $hls rules: When a segment is removed, all of the tags that apply only to that segment are also removedWhen there is a tag that applies to multiple segments, and all of those segments are removed, the tag is also removedSince there is no way to recognize different kinds of tags by syntax, we recognize all of the tags specified by the RFC, plus some non-standard tags that we have seen in the field. Any lines starting with # and not recognized as a tag are passed through without modification, and are not matched against the rulesTags will not be matched if they apply to the entire playlist, and $hls rrules cannot be used to remove them, as these rule types are intended for segment removals. If you know what you are doing, you can use $replace rules to remove or rewrite just a single tag from the playlist An example of a transformation done by the rules: Original response #EXTM3U #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10 #EXTINF,5 preroll.ts #UPLYNK-SEGMENT:abc123,ad #UPLYNK-KEY:aabb1122 #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY #EXTINF,10 01.ts #EXTINF,10 02.ts #UPLYNK-SEGMENT:abc123,segment #UPLYNK-KEY:ccdd2233 #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY #EXTINF,10 01.ts #EXTINF,10 02.ts #EXT-X-ENDLIST  Applied rules ||example.org^$hls=preroll ||example.org^$hls=/#UPLYNK-SEGMENT:.*\\,ad/t  Modified response #EXTM3U #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10 #UPLYNK-SEGMENT:abc123,segment #UPLYNK-KEY:ccdd2233 #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY #EXTINF,10 01.ts #EXTINF,10 02.ts #EXT-X-ENDLIST  Restrictions $hls rules are only allowed in trusted filters.$hls rules are compatible with the modifiers $domain, $third-party, $app, $important, $match-case, and $xmlhttprequest only.$hls rules only apply to HLS playlists, which are UTF-8 encoded text starting with the line #EXTM3U. Any other response will not be modified by these rules.$hls rules do not apply if the size of the original response is more than 10 MB. Compatibility Rules with the $hls modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10 or later. $inline-script​ The $inline-script modifier is designed to block inline JavaScript embedded into the web page, using Content Security Policy (CSP). It improves security and privacy by preventing application of inline ads or potentially malicious scripts. The rule ||example.org^$inline-script is converting into the CSP-syntax rule: ||example.org^$csp=script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: data: blob: mediastream: filesystem:  $inline-font​ The $inline-font modifier is designed to block inline fonts embedded into the web page, using Content Security Policy (CSP). It improves security and privacy by preventing application of inline fonts that could be used for data collection and fingerprinting. The rule ||example.org^$inline-font is converting into the CSP-syntax rule: ||example.org^$csp=font-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: data: blob: mediastream: filesystem:  $jsonprune​ $jsonprune rules modify the response to a matching request by removing JSON items that match a modified JSONPath expression. They do not modify responses which are not valid JSON documents. In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android running CoreLibs v1.11 or later, $jsonprune also supports modifying JSONP (padded JSON) documents. Syntax ||example.org^$jsonprune=expression removes items that match the modified JSONPath expression expression from the response. Due to the way rule parsing works, the characters $ and , must be escaped with \\ inside expression. The modified JSONPath syntax has the following differences from the original: Script expressions are not supportedThe supported filter expressions are: ?(has &lt;key&gt;) — true if the current object has the specified key?(key-eq &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;) — true if the current object has the specified key, and its value is equal to the specified value?(key-substr &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;) — true if the specified value is a substring of the value of the specified key of the current object Whitespace outside of double- or single-quoted strings has no meaningBoth double- and single-quoted strings can be usedExpressions ending with .. are not supportedMultiple array slices can be specified in square brackets There are various online tools that make working with JSONPath expressions more convenient: https://www.site24x7.com/tools/jsonpath-finder-validator.html https://jsonpathfinder.com/ https://jsonpath.com/ Keep in mind, though, that all JSONPath implementations have unique features/quirks and are subtly incompatible with each other. Exceptions Basic URL exceptions shall not disable rules with $jsonprune modifier. They can be disabled as described below: @@||example.org^$jsonprune disables all $jsonprune rules for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$jsonprune=text disable all $jsonprune rules with the value of the $jsonprune modifier equal to text for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^. $jsonprune rules can also be disabled by $document, $content and $urlblock exception rules. nota When multiple $jsonprune rules match the same request, they are sorted in lexicographical order, the first rule is applied to the original response, and each of the remaining rules is applied to the result of applying the previous one. Examples ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$..[one\\, &quot;two three&quot;] removes all occurrences of the keys &quot;one&quot; and &quot;two three&quot; anywhere in the JSON document. Input { &quot;one&quot;: 1, &quot;two&quot;: { &quot;two three&quot;: 23, &quot;four five&quot;: 45 } }  Output { &quot;two&quot;: { &quot;four five&quot;: 45 } }  ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$.a[?(has ad_origin)] removes all children of a that have an ad_origin key. Input { &quot;a&quot;: [ { &quot;ad_origin&quot;: &quot;https://example.org&quot;, &quot;b&quot;: 42 }, { &quot;b&quot;: 1234 } ] }  Output { &quot;a&quot;: [ { &quot;b&quot;: 1234 } ] }  ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$.*.*[?(key-eq 'Some key' 'Some value')] removes all items that are at nesting level 3 and have a property &quot;Some key&quot; equal to &quot;Some value&quot;. Input { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: {&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Some value&quot;}, &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Other value&quot;}}}, &quot;e&quot;: {&quot;f&quot;: [{&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Some value&quot;}, {&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Other value&quot;}]} }  Output { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;d&quot;: {&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Other value&quot;}}}, &quot;e&quot;: {&quot;f&quot;: [{&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Other value&quot;}]} }  Nested JSONPath expressions In AdGuard for Windows, Mac and Android running CoreLibs v1.11 or later, JSONPath expressions may be used as keys in filter expressions. ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$.elems[?(has &quot;\\$.a.b.c&quot;)] removes all children of elems which have a property selectable by the JSONPath expression $.a.b.c. Input { &quot;elems&quot;: [ { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: 123}}, &quot;k&quot;: &quot;v&quot; }, { &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;e&quot;: {&quot;f&quot;: 123}}, &quot;k1&quot;: &quot;v1&quot; } ] }  Output { &quot;elems&quot;: [ { &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;e&quot;: {&quot;f&quot;: 123}}, &quot;k1&quot;: &quot;v1&quot; } ] }  ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$.elems[?(key-eq &quot;\\$.a.b.c&quot; &quot;abc&quot;)] removes all children of elems which have a property selectable by the JSONPath expression $.a.b.c with a value equal to &quot;abc&quot;. Input { &quot;elems&quot;: [ { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: 123}}, }, { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: &quot;abc&quot;}} } ] }  Output { &quot;elems&quot;: [ { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: 123}} } ] }  Restrictions $jsonprune rules are only compatible with these specific modifiers: $domain, $third-party, $app, $important, $match-case, and $xmlhttprequest.$jsonprune rules do not apply if the size of the original response is more than 10 MB. Compatibility Rules with the $jsonprune modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10 or later. $network​ This is basically a Firewall-like rule allowing to fully block or unblock access to a specified remote address. $network rules match IP addresses only! You cannot use them to block or unblock access to a domain.To match an IPv6 address, you have to use the collapsed syntax, e.g. use [2001:4860:4860::8888]$network instead of [2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8888]$network.An allowlist $network rule makes AdGuard bypass data to the matching endpoint, hence there will be no further filtering at all.If the IP part starts and ends with / character, it is treated as a regular expression. We recommend to get acquainted with this article for better understanding of regular expressions. Restrictions The $network modifier can only be used in rules together with the $app and $important modifiers, and not with any other modifiers. Examples 174.129.166.49:3478^$network blocks access to 174.129.166.49:3478 (but not to 174.129.166.49:34788).[2001:4860:4860::8888]:443^$network blocks access to [2001:4860:4860::8888]:443.174.129.166.49$network blocks access to 174.129.166.49:*.@@174.129.166.49$network makes AdGuard bypass data to the endpoint. No other rules will be applied./.+:3[0-9]{4}/$network blocks access to any port from 30000 to 39999./8.8.8.(:?8|4)/$network blocks access to both 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.8.4. Compatibility Only AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android are technically capable of using rules with $network modifier. $permissions​ This modifier completely changes the rule behavior. If it is applied to a rule, the rule will not block the matching request. Response headers will be modified instead. info In order to use this type of rules, it is required to have a basic understanding of the Permissions Policy security layer. For the requests matching a $permissions rule, AdGuard strengthens response's permissions policy by adding an additional permission policy equal to the $permissions modifier contents. $permissions rules are applied independently from any other rule type. Only document-level exceptions can influence it (see the examples section), but no other basic rules. Multiple rules matching a single request. In case if multiple $permissions rules match a single request, AdGuard will apply each of them. Syntax $permissions value syntax is similar to the Permissions-Policy header syntax with one exception: comma that separates several features MUST be escaped — see examples below. The list of the available directives is available here. $permissions value can be empty in the case of exception rules — see examples below. Examples ||example.org^$permissions=autoplay=() disallows autoplay media requested through the HTMLMediaElement interface across example.org.@@||example.org/page/*$permissions=autoplay=() disables all rules with the $permissions modifier exactly matching autoplay=() on all the pages matching the rule pattern. For instance, the rule above.@@||example.org/page/*$permissions disables all the $permissions rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern.$domain=example.org|example.com,permissions=storage-access=()\\, camera=() disallows using the Storage Access API to request access to unpartitioned cookies and using video input devices across example.org and example.com.@@||example.org^$document or @@||example.org^$urlblock disables all the $permission rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern. Restrictions Characters forbidden in the $permissions value: $$permissions is compatible with three types of modifiers: $domain, $important, and $subdocument Compatibility Rules with the $permissions modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.11 or later. $redirect​ AdGuard is able to redirect web requests to a local &quot;resource&quot;. Syntax AdGuard uses the same filtering rule syntax as uBlock Origin. Also, it is compatible with ABP $rewrite=abp-resource modifier. $redirect is a modifier for the basic filtering rules so rules with this modifier support all other basic modifiers like $domain, $third-party, $script, etc. The value of the $redirect modifier must be the name of the resource that will be used for redirection. Disabling $redirect rules​ ||example.org/script.js$script,redirect=noopjs — this rule redirects all requests to example.org/script.js to the resource named noopjs.||example.org/test.mp4$media,redirect=noopmp4-1s — this rule redirects all requests to example.org/test.mp4 to the resource named noopmp4-1s.@@||example.org^$redirect will disable all $redirect rules for URLs that match ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$redirect=nooptext will disable all rules with $redirect=nooptext for any request that matches ||example.org^. More information on redirects and their usage is available on GitHub. Priorities of $redirect rules​ $redirect rules have higher priority than regular basic blocking rules. This means that if there is a basic blocking rule, the $redirect rule will override it. Allowlist rules with @@ mark have higher priority than $redirect rules. If a basic rule with the $important modifier and the $redirect rule matches the same URL, the latter is overridden unless it's also marked as $important. In short: $important &gt; @@ &gt; $redirect &gt; basic rules. Go to rules priorities for more details. Compatibility Rules with $redirect modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and AdGuard for Safari.$redirect in uBlock Origin supports specifying priority, e.g. $redirect=noopjs:42. AdGuard does not support it and instead just discards the priority postfix. $redirect-rule​ This is basically an alias to $redirect since it has the same &quot;redirection&quot; values and the logic is almost similar. The difference is that $redirect-rule is applied only in the case when the target request is blocked by a different basic rule. Go to rules priorities for more details. Negating $redirect-rule works exactly the same way as for regular $redirect rules. Even more than that, @@||example.org^$redirect will negate both $redirect and $redirect-rule rules. Examples ||example.org/script.js ||example.org^$redirect-rule=noopjs  In this case, only requests to example.org/script.js will be &quot;redirected&quot; to noopjs. All other requests to example.org will be kept intact. Compatibility Rules with $redirect-rule modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS, and AdGuard for Safari. $referrerpolicy​ These rules allow overriding of a page's referrer policy. Responses to matching requests will have all of their Referrer-Policy headers replaced with a single header with the value equal to the matching rule's modifier value. If the response carries an HTML document with a &lt;meta name=&quot;referrer&quot;... tag, the content attribute of the tag will also be replaced with the modifier value. An exception rule with a modifier value disables the blocking rule with the same modifier value. An exception rule without a modifier value disables all matched referrer-policy rules. If a request matches multiple $referrerpolicy rules not disabled by exceptions, only one of them (it is not specified which one) is applied. $referrerpolicy rules without specified content-type modifiers apply to $document and $subdocument content types. Examples ||example.com^$referrerpolicy=unsafe-url overrides the referrer policy for example.com with unsafe-url.@@||example.com^$referrerpolicy=unsafe-url disables the previous rule.@@||example.com/abcd.html^$referrerpolicy disables all $referrerpolicy rules on example.com/abcd.html. Compatibility Rules with the $referrerpolicy modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.12 or later. $removeheader​ Rules with $removeheader modifier are intended to remove headers from HTTP requests and responses. The initial motivation for this rule type is to be able to get rid of the Refresh header which is often used to redirect users to an undesirable location. However, this is not the only case where this modifier can be useful. Just like $csp, $redirect, $removeparam, and $cookie, this modifier exists independently, rules with it do not depend on the regular basic rules, i.e. regular exception or blocking rules will not affect it. By default, it only affects response headers. However, you can also change it to remove headers from HTTP requests as well. Syntax Basic syntax ||example.org^$removeheader=header-name removes a response header called header-name||example.org^$removeheader=request:header-name removes a request header called header-name $removeheader is case-insensitive, but we suggest always using lower case. Negating $removeheader This type of rules works pretty much the same way it works with $csp and $redirect modifiers. Use @@ to negate $removeheader: @@||example.org^$removeheader negates all $removeheader rules for URLs that match ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$removeheader=header negates the rule with $removeheader=header for any request matching ||example.org^. $removeheader rules can also be disabled by $document and $urlblock exception rules. But basic exception rules without modifiers will not do that. For example, @@||example.com^ will not disable $removeheader=p for requests to example.com, but @@||example.com^$urlblock will. nota In case of multiple $removeheader rules matching a single request, we will apply each of them one by one. Examples ||example.org^$removeheader=refresh removes Refresh header from all HTTP responses returned by example.org and its subdomains. ||example.org^$removeheader=request:x-client-data removes X-Client-Data header from all HTTP requests. Next block of rules removes Refresh and Location headers from all HTTP responses returned by example.org save for requests to example.org/path/*, for which no headers will be removed: ||example.org^$removeheader=refresh ||example.org^$removeheader=location @@||example.org/path/$removeheader  Restrictions This type of rules can be used only in trusted filters. In order to avoid compromising the security $removeheader cannot remove headers from the list below: access-control-allow-originaccess-control-allow-credentialsaccess-control-allow-headersaccess-control-allow-methodsaccess-control-expose-headersaccess-control-max-ageaccess-control-request-headersaccess-control-request-methodorigintiming-allow-originallowcross-origin-embedder-policycross-origin-opener-policycross-origin-resource-policycontent-security-policycontent-security-policy-report-onlyexpect-ctfeature-policyorigin-isolationstrict-transport-securityupgrade-insecure-requestsx-content-type-optionsx-download-optionsx-frame-optionsx-permitted-cross-domain-policiesx-powered-byx-xss-protectionpublic-key-pinspublic-key-pins-report-onlysec-websocket-keysec-websocket-extensionssec-websocket-acceptsec-websocket-protocolsec-websocket-versionp3psec-fetch-modesec-fetch-destsec-fetch-sitesec-fetch-userreferrer-policycontent-typecontent-lengthacceptaccept-encodinghostconnectiontransfer-encodingupgrade $removeheader rules are only compatible with $domain, $third-party, $app, $important, $match-case, and content type modifiers such as $script and $stylesheet. The rules which have any other modifiers are considered invalid and will be discarded. Compatibility Rules with $removeheader modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, and AdGuard Browser Extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. $removeparam​ nota $queryprune is an alias of $removeparam. Since $queryprune is deprecated, avoid using it and use $removeparam instead. Rules with $removeparam modifier are intended to strip query parameters from requests' URLs. Please note that such rules are only applied to GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and sometimes POST requests. $removeparam rules that do not have any content type modifiers will match only requests where content type is document. Syntax Basic syntax $removeparam=param removes query parameter with the name param from URLs of any request, e.g. a request to http://example.com/page?param=1&amp;another=2 will be transformed into http://example.com/page?another=2. Compatibility Rules with $removeparam modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac and, Android with CoreLibs v1.7 or later and AdGuard Browser Extension v3.6 or later. Regular expressions You can also use regular expressions to match query parameters and/or their values: $removeparam=/regexp/[options] — removes query parameters that matches the regexp regular expression from URLs of any request. Unlike basic syntax, it means &quot;remove query parameters normalized to a name=value string which match the regexp regular expression&quot;. [options] here is the list of regular expression options. At the moment, the only supported option is i which makes matching case-insensitive. Escaping special characters Do not forget to escape special characters like ,, / and $ in the regular expressions. Use \\ character for that purpose. For example, an escaped comma should look like this: \\,. nota Regexp-type rules target both name and value of the parameter. To minimize mistakes, it is safer to start every regexp with /^ unless you specifically target parameter values. We will try to detect and ignore unescaped $ automatically using a simple rule of thumb — it is not an options delimiter if all three are true: It looks like $/There is another slash character / to the left of itThere is another unescaped dollar sign $ to the left of that slash character Remove all query parameters Specify naked $removeparam to remove all query parameters: ||example.org^$removeparam — removes all query parameters from URLs matching ||example.org^. Inversion Use ~ to apply inversion: $removeparam=~param — removes all query parameters with the name different from param.$removeparam=~/regexp/ — removes all query parameters that do not match the regexp regular expression. Negating $removeparam This sort of rules work pretty much the same way it works with $csp and $redirect modifiers. Use @@ to negate $removeparam: @@||example.org^$removeparam negates all $removeparam rules for URLs that match ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$removeparam=param negates the rule with $removeparam=param for any request matching ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$removeparam=/regexp/ negates the rule with $removeparam=/regexp/ for any request matching ||example.org^. Multiple rules matching a single request In the case when multiple $removeparam rules match a single request, each of them will be applied one by one. Examples $removeparam=/^(utm_source|utm_medium|utm_term)=/ $removeparam=/^(utm_content|utm_campaign|utm_referrer)=/ @@||example.com^$removeparam  With these rules some UTM parameters will be stripped out from any request, except that requests to example.com will not be stripped at all, e.g. http://google.com/page?utm_source=s&amp;utm_referrer=fb.com&amp;utm_content=img will be transformed to http://google.com/page, but http://example.com/page?utm_source=s&amp;utm_referrer=fb.com&amp;utm_content=img will not be affected by the blocking rule. $removeparam=utm_source removes utm_source query parameter from all requests. $removeparam=/utm_.*/ removes all utm_* query parameters from URL queries of any request, e.g. a request to http://example.com/page?utm_source=test will be transformed to http://example.com/page. $removeparam=/^utm_source=campaign$/ removes utm_source query parameter with the value equal to campaign. It does not touch other utm_source parameters.

Restrictions Rules with $removeparam modifier can be used only in trusted filters.$removeparam rules are compatible with basic modifiers, content-type modifiers, and with $important and $app modifiers. Rules with any other modifiers are considered invalid and will be discarded. Compatibility Rules with $removeparam modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android and AdGuard Browser Extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.$removeparam syntax for regular expressions is supported by AdGuard Browser Extension v4.0 and AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.8 or later.POST request types are supported only by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android with CoreLibs v1.10 or later. $replace​ This modifier completely changes the rule behavior. If it is applied, the rule will not block the request. The response is going to be modified instead. You will need some knowledge of regular expressions to use $replace modifier. Features $replace rules apply to any text response, but will not apply to binary (media, image, object, etc.).$replace rules do not apply if the size of the original response is more than 10 MB.$replace rules have a higher priority than other basic rules (including exception rules). So if a request corresponds to two different rules one of which has the $replace modifier, this rule will be applied.Document-level exception rules with $content or $document modifiers do disable $replace rules for requests matching them.Other document-level exception rules ($generichide, $elemhide or $jsinject modifiers) are applied alongside $replace rules. It means that you can modify the page content with a $replace rule and disable cosmetic rules there at the same time. $replace value can be empty in the case of exception rules. See examples section for further information. Multiple rules matching a single request In case if multiple $replace rules match a single request, we will apply each of them. The order is defined alphabetically. Syntax In general, $replace syntax is similar to replacement with regular expressions in Perl. replace = &quot;/&quot; regexp &quot;/&quot; replacement &quot;/&quot; modifiers  regexp — a regular expression.replacement — a string that will be used to replace the string corresponding to regexp.modifiers — a regular expression flags. For example, i — insensitive search, or s — single-line mode. In the $replace value, two characters must be escaped: comma , and dollar sign $. Use backslash \\ for it. For example, an escaped comma looks like this: \\,. Examples ||example.org^$replace=/(&lt;VAST[\\s\\S]*?&gt;)[\\s\\S]*&lt;\\/VAST&gt;/\\$1&lt;\\/VAST&gt;/i  There are three parts in this rule: regexp — (&lt;VAST(.|\\s)*?&gt;)(.|\\s)*&lt;\\/VAST&gt;;replacement — \\$1&lt;\\/VAST&gt; where $ is escaped;modifiers — i for insensitive search. You can see how this rule works here: http://regexr.com/3cesk Multiple $replace rules ||example.org^$replace=/X/Y/||example.org^$replace=/Z/Y/@@||example.org/page/*$replace=/Z/Y/ Both rule 1 and 2 will be applied to all requests sent to example.org.Rule 2 is disabled for requests matching ||example.org/page/, but rule 1 still works! Disabling $replace rules @@||example.org^$replace will disable all $replace rules matching ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$document or @@||example.org^$content will disable all $replace rules originated from pages of example.org including the page itself. Restrictions Rules with $replace modifier can be used only in trusted filters. Compatibility Rules with $replace modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android and AdGuard Browser Extension for Firefox. Such rules do not work in extensions for other browsers because they are unable to modify content on the network level. noop​ noop modifier does nothing and can be used solely to increase rules' readability. It consists of a sequence of underscore characters (_) of any length and can appear in a rule as many times as needed. Examples ||example.com$_,removeparam=/^ss\\\\$/,_,image ||example.com$replace=/bad/good/,___,~third-party  Compatibility Rules with noop modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $empty (deprecated)​ Deprecation notice This modifier is deprecated in favor of the $redirect modifier. Rules with $empty are still supported and being converted into $redirect=nooptext now but the support shall be removed in the future. Usually, blocked requests look like a server error to browser. If you use $empty modifier, AdGuard will emulate a blank response from the server with200 OK status. Examples ||example.org^$empty returns an empty response to all requests to example.org and all subdomains. Compatibility Rules with $empty modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS, and AdGuard for Safari. $mp4 (deprecated)​ Deprecation notice This modifier is deprecated in favor of the $redirect modifier. Rules with $mp4 are still supported and being converted into $redirect=noopmp4-1s,media now but the support shall be removed in the future. As a response to blocked request AdGuard returns a short video placeholder. Examples ||example.com/videos/$mp4 blocks all video downloads from ||example.com/videos/* and changes the response to a video placeholder. Compatibility Rules with $mp4 modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS, and AdGuard for Safari. "},{"title":"Rule priorities​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to create your own ad filters","url":"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#rule-priorities","content":"Each rule has its own priority, which is necessary when several rules match the request and the filtering engine needs to select one of them. Priority is measured by a positive integer. Collisions When two rules with the same priority match the same request, it depends on the filtering engine implementation which one will be selected. info The concept of rule priorities becomes increasingly important in light of Manifest V3 as the existing rules need to be converted to declarativeNetRequest rules. Priority calculation​ To calculate priority, we've categorized modifiers into different groups. These groups are ranked based on their priority, from lowest to highest. A modifier that significantly narrows the scope of a rule adds more weight to its total priority. Conversely, if a rule applies to a broader range of requests, its priority decreases. It's worth noting that there are cases where a single-parameter modifier has a higher priority than multi-parameter ones. For instance, in the case of $domain=example.com|example.org, a rule that includes two domains has a slightly broader effective area than a rule with one specified domain, therefore its priority is lower. The base priority of any rule is 1. If the calculated priority is a floating-point number, it will be rounded up to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the calculated priority. Compatibility The concept of priority has been introduced in tsurlfilter v2.1.0 and CoreLibs v1.13. Before that AdGuard didn't have any special priority computation algorithm and collisions handling could be different depending on AdGuard product and version.AdGuard for iOS, Safari, and AdGuard Content Blocker rely on the browsers implementation and they cannot follow the rules specified here. nota Modifier aliases (1p, 3p, etc.) are not included in these categories, however, they are utilized within the engine to compute the rule priority. Basic modifiers, the presence of each adds 1 to the priority​ $app with negated applications using ~,$denyallow,$domain with negated domains using ~,$match-case,$method with negated methods using ~,$third-party,$to,restricted content-types with ~. When dealing with a negated domain, app, method, or content-type, we add 1 point for the existence of the modifier itself, regardless of the quantity of negated domains or content-types. This is because the rule's scope is already infinitely broad. Put simply, by prohibiting multiple domains, content-types, methods or apps, the scope of the rule becomes only minimally smaller. Defined content-type modifiers, defined methods, defined headers, $popup, special exceptions​ All allowed content types: $document,$font,$image,$media,$object,$other,$ping,$script,$stylesheet,$subdocument,$websocket,$xmlhttprequest; This also includes rules that implicitly add the modifier $document: $popup; Or special exceptions that implicitly add $document,subdocument: $content,$elemhide,$extension,$genericblock,$generichide,$jsinject,$specifichide,$urlblock; Or allowed methods via $method. Or rules with $header. The presence of any content-type modifiers adds (50 + 50 / N), where N is the number of modifiers present, for example: ||example.com^$image,script will add 50 + 50 / 2 = 50 + 25 = 75 to the total weight of the rule. The $popup also belongs to this category, because it implicitly adds the modifier $document. Similarly, specific exceptions add $document,subdocument. If there is a $method modifier in the rule with allowed methods it adds (50 + 50 / N), where N is the number of methods allowed, for example: ||example.com^$method=GET|POST|PUT will add 50 + 50 / 3 = 50 + 16.6 = 67 to the total weight of the rule. If there is a $header modifier in the rule it adds 50. $domain or $app with allowed domains or applications​ Specified domains through $domain or specified applications through $app add 100 + 100 / N, where N is the number of modifier values for example: ||example.com^$domain=example.com|example.org|example.net will add 100 + 100 / 3 = 134.3 = 135 or ||example.com^$app=org.example.app1|org.example.app2 will add 100 + 100 / 2 = 151 or ||example.com^$domain=example.com,app=org.example.app1|org.example.app2 will add 100 + 100/1 ($domain part) and 100 + 100/2 ($app part), totaling 350. Modifier values that are regexps or tld will be interpreted as normal entries of the form example.com and counted one by one, for example: ||example.com^$domain=example.* will add 100 + 100 / 1 = 200 or ||example.com^$domain=example.*|adguard.* will add 100 + 100 / 2 = 150. $redirect rules​ $redirect,$redirect-rule. Each of which adds 10^3 to rule priority. Specific exceptions​ $content,$elemhide,$extension,$genericblock,$generichide,$jsinject,$specifichide,$urlblock; Each of which adds 10^4 to the priority. As well as exception with $document modifier: because it's an alias for $elemhide,content,jsinject,urlblock,extension. It will add 10^4 for each modifier from the top list, 10^4 * 5 in total. In addition, each of these exceptions implicitly adds the two allowed content-type modifiers $document,subdocument. Allowlist rules​ Modifier @@ adds 10^5 to rule priority. $important rules​ Modifier $important adds 10^6 to rule priority. Rules for which there is no priority weight​ Other modifiers, which are supposed to perform additional post- or pre-processing of requests, do not add anything to the rules priority. nota The $replace modifier takes precedence over all blocking rules of categories 1-3, as well as exception rules from categories 3-5, except $content, because an exception with the $content modifier overrides all $replace rules. Examples​ Example 1 ||example.com^ Weight of the rule without modifiers: 1. Example 2 ||example.com^$match-case Weight of the rule: base weight + weight of the modifier from category 1: 1 + 1 = 2. Example 3 ||example.org^$removeparam=p Weight of the rule: base weight + 0, since $removeparam is not involved in the priority calculation: 1 + 0 = 1. Example 4 ||example.org^$document,redirect=nooptext Rule weight: base weight + allowed content type, category 3 + $redirect from category 6: 1 + (100 + 100 / 1) + 1000 = 1201.

It is similar to applying { display: none; } style to selected element. Element hiding rules may operate differently depending on the platform. Syntax​  rule = [domains] &quot;##&quot; selector domains = [domain0, domain1[, ...[, domainN]]]  selector — CSS selector, defines the elements to be hidden.domains — domain restriction for the rule. If you want to limit the rule application area to certain domains, just enter them separated with commas. For example: example.org,example.com##selector. This rule will be also applied to all subdomains of example.org and example.com. If you want the rule not to be applied to certain domains, start a domain name with ~ sign. For example: ~example.org##selector. You can use both approaches in a single rule. For example, example.org,~subdomain.example.org##domain will work for example.org and all subdomains, except subdomain.example.org. nota Element hiding rules are not dependent on each other. If there is a rule example.org##selector in the filter and you add ~example.org##selector both rules will be applied independently. Examples example.com##div.textad — hides a div with the class textad at example.com and all subdomains.example.com,example.org###adblock — hides an element with attribute id equals adblock at example.com, example.org and all subdomains.~example.com##.textad — hides an element with the class textad at all domains, except example.com and its subdomains. Limitations Safari does not support both permitted and restricted domains. So the rules like example.org,~foo.example.org##.textad are invalid in AdGuard for Safari. Exceptions Exceptions can disable some rules on particular domains. They are very similar to usual exception rules, but instead of ## you have to use #@#. For example, there is a rule in filter: ##.textad  If you want to disable it for example.com, you can create an exception rule: example.com#@#.textad  Sometimes, it may be necessary to disable all restriction rules. For example, to conduct tests. To do this, use the exclusion rule without specifying a domain. It will completely disable matching CSS elemhide rule on ALL domains: #@#.textad  The same can be achieved by adding this rule: *#@#.textad  We recommend to use this kind of exceptions only if it is not possible to change the hiding rule itself. In other cases it is better to change the original rule, using domain restrictions. "},{"title":"CSS rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to create your own ad filters","url":"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#cosmetic-css-rules","content":"Sometimes, simple hiding of an element is not enough to deal with advertising. For example, blocking an advertising element can just break the page layout. In this case AdGuard can use rules that are much more flexible than hiding rules.

Syntax  rule = [domains] &quot;#$#&quot; selector &quot;{&quot; style &quot;}&quot; domains = [domain0, domain1[, ...[, domainN]]]  selector — CSS selector, that defines the elements we want to apply the style to.domains — domain restriction for the rule.

Examples example.com#$#body { background-color: #333!important; }  This rule will apply a style background-color: #333!important; to the body element at example.com and all subdomains. Exceptions Just like with element hiding, there is a type of rules that disable the selected CSS style rule for particular domains. Exception rule syntax is almost the same, you just have to change #$# to #@$#. For example, there is a rule in filter: #$#.textad { visibility: hidden; }  If you want to disable it for example.com, you can create an exception rule: example.com#@$#.textad { visibility: hidden; }  We recommend to use this kind of exceptions only if it is not possible to change the CSS rule itself.

To solve this problem AdGuard extends CSS capabilities by adding support for the new pseudo-elements. We have developed a separate open-source library for non-standard element selecting and applying CSS styles with extended properties. The idea of extended capabilities is an opportunity to match DOM elements with selectors based on their own representation (style, text content, etc.) or relations with other elements. There is also an opportunity to apply styles with non-standard CSS properties. Application area Extended selectors can be used in any cosmetic rule, whether they are element hiding rules or CSS rules. Compatibility Rules with extended CSS selectors are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. Syntax Regardless of the CSS pseudo-classes you are using in the rule, you can use special markers to force applying these rules by ExtendedCss. It is recommended to use these markers for all extended CSS cosmetic rules so that it was easier to find them. The syntax for extended CSS rules: #?# — for element hiding, #@?# — for exceptions#$?# — for CSS rules, #@$?# — for exceptions We strongly recommend using these markers any time when you use an extended CSS selector. Examples example.org#?#div:has(&gt; a[target=&quot;_blank&quot;][rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;]) — this rule blocks all div elements containing a child node that has a link with the attributes [target=&quot;_blank&quot;][rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;]. The rule applies only to example.org and its subdomains.example.com#$?#h3:contains(cookies) { display: none!important; } — this rule sets the style display: none!important to all h3 elements that contain the word cookies. The rule applies only to example.com and all its subdomains.example.net#?#.banner:matches-css(width: 360px) — this rule blocks all .banner elements with the style property width: 360px. The rule applies only to example.net and its subdomains.example.net#@?#.banner:matches-css(width: 360px) — this rule will disable the previous rule. You can apply standard CSS selectors using the ExtendedCss library by using the rule marker #?#, e.g. #?#div.banner. Learn more about how to debug extended selectors. nota Some pseudo-classes do not require selector before it. Still adding the universal selector * makes an extended selector easier to read, even though it has no effect on the matching behavior. So selector #block :has(&gt; .inner) works exactly like #block *:has(&gt; .inner) but second one is more obvious. Pseudo-class names are case-insensitive, e.g. :HAS() works as :has(). Still the lower-case names are used commonly. ExtendedCss Limitations​ CSS comments and at-rules are not supported. Specific pseudo-class may have its own limitations: :has(), :xpath(), :nth-ancestor(), :upward(), :is(), :not(), and :remove(). Pseudo-class :has()​ Draft CSS 4.0 specification describes the :has() pseudo-class. Unfortunately, it is not yet supported by all popular browsers. nota Rules with the :has() pseudo-class must use the native implementation of :has() if they use ## marker and if it is possible, i.e. with no other extended selectors inside. To force applying of ExtendedCss rules with :has(), use #?#/#$?# marker explicitly. Compatibility with other pseudo-classes Synonyms :-abp-has() is supported by ExtendedCss for better compatibility. Removal notice :if() is no longer supported as a synonym for :has(). Syntax [target]:has(selector)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be skipped for checking any elementselector — required, standard or extended CSS selector The pseudo-class :has() selects the target elements that fit to the selector. Also the selector can start with a combinator. A selector list can be set in selector as well. In this case all selectors in the list are being matched for now. In the future it will be fixed for &lt;forgiving-relative-selector-list&gt; as argument. :has() limitations​ Usage of the :has() pseudo-class is restricted for some cases (2, 3): disallow :has() inside the pseudos accepting only compound selectors;disallow :has() after regular pseudo-elements. Native :has() pseudo-class does not allow :has(), :is(), :where() inside :has() argument to avoid increasing the :has() invalidation complexity (case 1). But ExtendedCss did not have such limitation earlier and filter lists already contain such rules, so we have not added this limitation to ExtendedCss and allow to use :has() inside :has() as it was possible before. To use it, just force ExtendedCss usage by setting #?#/#$?# rule marker. Native implementation does not allow any usage of :scope inside the :has() argument ([1], [2]). Still, there are some such rules in filter lists: div:has(:scope a) which we continue to support by simply converting them to div:has(&gt; a), as it used to be done previously. Examples div:has(.banner) selects all div elements which include an element with the banner class: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected &lt;span class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;inner element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  div:has(&gt; .banner) selects all div elements which include an banner class element as a direct child of div: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;child element&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  div:has(+ .banner) selects all div elements preceding banner class element which immediately follows the div and both are children of the same parent: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;adjacent sibling&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Not selected&lt;/span&gt;  div:has(~ .banner) selects all div elements preceding banner class element which follows the div but not necessarily immediately and both are children of the same parent: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span&gt;Not selected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;general sibling&lt;/p&gt;  div:has(span, .banner) selects all div elements which include both span element and banner class element: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected &lt;span&gt;child span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;child .banner&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Old syntax Backward compatible syntax for :has() is supported but not recommended. Pseudo-class :contains()​ The :contains() pseudo-class principle is very simple: it allows to select the elements that contain specified text or which content matches a specified regular expression. Regexp flags are supported. nota The :contains() pseudo-class uses the textContent element property for matching, not the innerHTML. Compatibility with other pseudo-classes Synonyms :-abp-contains() and :has-text() are supported for better compatibility. Syntax [target]:contains(match)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be skipped for checking any elementmatch — required, string or regular expression for matching element textContent. Regular expression flags are supported. Examples For such DOM: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;match&quot;&gt;Selected as IT contains &quot;banner&quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected &lt;div class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  the element div#match can be selected by any of these extended selectors: ! plain text div:contains(banner) ! regular expression div:contains(/as .* banner/) ! regular expression with flags div:contains(/it .* banner/gi)  nota Only the div with id=match is selected because the next element does not contain any text, and banner is a part of code, not a text. Old syntax Backward compatible syntax for :contains() is supported but not recommended. Pseudo-class :matches-css()​ The :matches-css() pseudo-class allows to match the element by its current style properties. The work of the pseudo-class is based on using the Window.getComputedStyle() method. Syntax [target]:matches-css([pseudo-element, ] property: pattern)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be skipped for checking any elementpseudo-element — optional, valid standard pseudo-element, e.g. before, after, first-line, etc.property — required, a name of CSS property to check the element forpattern — required, a value pattern that is using the same simple wildcard matching as in the basic url filtering rules OR a regular expression. For this type of matching, AdGuard always does matching in a case-insensitive manner. In the case of a regular expression, the pattern looks like /regexp/. Special characters escaping and unescaping For non-regexp patterns (,),[,] must be unescaped, e.g. :matches-css(background-image:url(data:*)). For regexp patterns \\ should be escaped, e.g. :matches-css(background-image: /^url\\\\(&quot;data:image\\\\/gif;base64.+/). Examples For such DOM: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; #matched::before { content: &quot;Block me&quot; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;matched&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;not-matched&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  the div elements with pseudo-element ::before and with specified content property can be selected by any of these extended selectors: ! string pattern div:matches-css(before, content: block me) ! string pattern with wildcard div:matches-css(before, content: block*) ! regular expression pattern div:matches-css(before, content: /block me/)  Restrictions Regexp patterns do not support flags. Compatibility Obsolete pseudo-classes :matches-css-before() and :matches-css-after() are no longer recommended but still are supported for better compatibility. Old syntax Backward compatible syntax for :matches-css() is supported but not recommended. Pseudo-class :matches-attr()​ The :matches-attr() pseudo-class allows selecting an element by its attributes, especially if they are randomized. Syntax [target]:matches-attr(&quot;name&quot;[=&quot;value&quot;])  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be skipped for checking any elementname — required, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for attribute name matchingvalue — optional, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for attribute value matching Escaping special characters For regexp patterns &quot; and \\ should be escaped, e.g. div:matches-attr(class=/[\\\\w]{5}/). Examples div:matches-attr(&quot;ad-link&quot;) selects the element div#target1: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot; ad-link=&quot;1random23-banner_240x400&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  div:matches-attr(&quot;data-*&quot;=&quot;adBanner&quot;) selects the element div#target2: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot; data-1random23=&quot;adBanner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  div:matches-attr(*unit*=/^click$/) selects the element div#target3: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target3&quot; random123-unit094=&quot;click&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  *:matches-attr(&quot;/.{5,}delay$/&quot;=&quot;/^[0-9]*$/&quot;) selects the element #target4: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;inner-random23 id=&quot;target4&quot; nt4f5be90delay=&quot;1000&quot;&gt;&lt;/inner-random23&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Restrictions Regexp patterns do not support flags. Pseudo-class :matches-property()​ The :matches-property() pseudo-class allows selecting an element by matching its properties. Syntax [target]:matches-property(&quot;name&quot;[=&quot;value&quot;])  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be skipped for checking any elementname — required, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for element property name matchingvalue — optional, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for element property value matching Escaping special characters For regexp patterns &quot; and \\ must be escaped, e.g. div:matches-property(prop=/[\\\\w]{4}/). nota Regexp patterns are supported in name for any property in chain, e.g. prop./^unit[\\\\d]{4}$/.type. Examples An element with such properties: divProperties = { id: 1, check: { track: true, unit_2random1: true, }, memoizedProps: { key: null, tag: 12, _owner: { effectTag: 1, src: 'ad.com', }, }, };  can be selected by any of these extended selectors: div:matches-property(check.track) div:matches-property(&quot;check./^unit_.{4,8}$/&quot;) div:matches-property(&quot;check.unit_*&quot;=true) div:matches-property(memoizedProps.key=&quot;null&quot;) div:matches-property(memoizedProps._owner.src=/ad/)  For filters maintainers To check properties of a specific element, do the following: Inspect the page element or select it in Elements tab of browser DevToolsRun console.dir($0) in Console tab Restrictions Regexp patterns do not support flags. Pseudo-class :xpath()​ The :xpath() pseudo-class allows selecting an element by evaluating an XPath expression. Syntax [target]:xpath(expression)  target- optional, standard or extended CSS selectorexpression — required, valid XPath expression :xpath() limitations​ target can be omitted so it is optional. For any other pseudo-class that would mean &quot;apply to all DOM nodes&quot;, but in case of :xpath() it just means &quot;apply to the whole document&quot;, and such applying slows elements selecting significantly. That's why rules like #?#:xpath(expression) are limited to looking inside the body tag. For example, rule #?#:xpath(//div[@data-st-area=\\'Advert\\']) is parsed as #?#body:xpath(//div[@data-st-area=\\'Advert\\']). Extended selectors with defined target as any selector — *:xpath(expression) — can still be used but it is not recommended, so target should be specified instead. Works properly only at the end of selector, except for pseudo-class :remove(). Examples :xpath(//*[@class=&quot;banner&quot;]) selects the element div#target1: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot; class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  :xpath(//*[@class=&quot;inner&quot;]/..) selects the element div#target2: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Pseudo-class :nth-ancestor()​ The :nth-ancestor() pseudo-class allows to lookup the nth ancestor relative to the previously selected element. subject:nth-ancestor(n)  subject — required, standard or extended CSS selectorn — required, number &gt;= 1 and &lt; 256, distance to the needed ancestor from the element selected by subject Syntax subject:nth-ancestor(n)  subject — required, standard or extended CSS selectorn — required, number &gt;= 1 and &lt; 256, distance to the needed ancestor from the element selected by subject :nth-ancestor() limitations​ The :nth-ancestor() pseudo-class is not supported inside the argument of the :not() pseudo-class. Examples For such DOM: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  .child:nth-ancestor(1) selects the element div#target1, div[class=&quot;inner&quot;]:nth-ancestor(3) selects the element div#target2. Pseudo-class :upward()​ The :upward() pseudo-class allows to lookup the ancestor relative to the previously selected element. Syntax subject:upward(ancestor)  subject — required, standard or extended CSS selectorancestor — required, specification for the ancestor of the element selected by subject, can be set as: number &gt;= 1 and &lt; 256 for distance to the needed ancestor, same as :nth-ancestor()standard CSS selector for matching closest ancestor :upward() limitations​ The :upward() pseudo-class is not supported inside the argument of the :not() pseudo-class. Examples For such DOM: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot; data=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  .inner:upward(div[data]) selects the element div#target1, .inner:upward(div[id]) selects the element div#target2, .child:upward(1) selects the element div#target1, .inner:upward(3) selects the element div#target2. Pseudo-class :remove() and pseudo-property remove​ Sometimes, it is necessary to remove a matching element instead of hiding it or applying custom styles. In order to do it, you can use the :remove() pseudo-class as well as the remove pseudo-property. Pseudo-class :remove() can be placed only at the end of a selector. Syntax ! pseudo-class selector:remove() ! pseudo-property selector { remove: true; }  selector — required, standard or extended CSS selector :remove() and remove limitations​ The :remove() pseudo-class is limited to work properly only at the end of selector. For applying the :remove() pseudo-class to any element, the universal selector * should be used. Otherwise such extended selector may be considered as invalid, e.g. .banner &gt; :remove() is not valid for removing any child element of banner class element, so it should look like .banner &gt; *:remove(). If the :remove() pseudo-class or the remove pseudo-property is used, all style properties are ignored except for the debug pseudo-property. Examples div.banner:remove() div:has(&gt; div[ad-attr]):remove() div:contains(advertisement) { remove: true; } div[class]:has(&gt; a &gt; img) { remove: true; }  nota Rules with the remove pseudo-property must use #$?# marker: $ for CSS-style rule syntax, ? for ExtendedCss syntax. Pseudo-class :is()​ The :is() pseudo-class allows to match any element that can be selected by any of selectors passed to it. Invalid selectors are skipped and the pseudo-class deals with valid ones with no error thrown. Our implementation of the native :is() pseudo-class. Syntax [target]:is(selectors)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be skipped for checking any elementselectors — forgiving selector list of standard or extended selectors. For extended selectors, only compound selectors are supported, not complex. :is() limitations​ Rules with the :is() pseudo-class must use the native implementation of :is() if rules use ## marker and it is possible, i.e. with no other extended selectors inside. To force applying ExtendedCss rules with :is(), use #?#/#$?# marker explicitly. If the :is() pseudo-class argument selectors is an extended selector, due to the way how the :is() pseudo-class is implemented in ExtendedCss v2.0, it is impossible to apply it to the top DOM node which is html, i.e. #?#html:is(&lt;extended-selectors&gt;) does not work. So if target is not defined or defined as the universal selector *, the extended pseudo-class applying is limited to html's children, e.g. rules #?#:is(...) and #?#*:is(...) are parsed as #?#html *:is(...). Please note that there is no such limitation for a standard selector argument, i.e. #?#html:is(.locked) works fine. Complex selectors with extended pseudo-classes are not supported as selectors argument for :is() pseudo-class, only compound ones are allowed. Check examples below for more details. Examples #container *:is(.inner, .footer) selects only the element div#target1: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt; &lt;div data=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot; class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Due to limitations :is(*:not([class]) &gt; .banner)' does not work but :is(*:not([class]):has(&gt; .banner)) can be used instead of it to select the element div#target2: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;span&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;inner paragraph&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Pseudo-class :not()​ The :not() pseudo-class allows to select elements which are not matched by selectors passed as argument. Invalid argument selectors are not allowed and error is to be thrown. Our implementation of the :not() pseudo-class. Syntax [target]:not(selectors)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be skipped for checking any elementselectors — list of standard or extended selectors :not() limitations​ Rules with the :not() pseudo-class must use the native implementation of :not() if rules use ## marker and it is possible, i.e. with no other extended selectors inside.

So if target is not defined or defined as the universal selector *, the extended pseudo-class applying is limited to html's children, e.g. rules #?#:not(...) and #?#*:not(...) are parsed as #?#html *:not(...). Please note that there is no such limitation for a standard selector argument, i.e. #?#html:not(.locked) works fine. The :not() is considered as a standard CSS pseudo-class inside the argument of the :upward() pseudo-class because :upward() supports only standard selectors. &quot;Up-looking&quot; pseudo-classes which are :nth-ancestor() and :upward() are not supported inside selectors argument for :not() pseudo-class. Examples #container &gt; *:not(h2, .text) selects only the element div#target1: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Header&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Pseudo-class :if-not() (removed)​ Removal notice The :if-not() pseudo-class is removed and is no longer supported. Rules with it are considered as invalid. This pseudo-class was basically a shortcut for :not(:has()). It was supported by ExtendedCss for better compatibility with some filters subscriptions.

Preprocessor directives can be used in the user rules or in the custom filters. Including a file​ The !#include directive allows to include contents of a specified file into the filter. It supports only files from the same origin to make sure that the filter maintainer is in control of the specified file. The included file can also contain pre- directives (even other !#include directives). Ad blockers should consider the case of recursive !#include and implement a protection mechanism. Syntax !#include file_path  where file_path is a same origin absolute or relative file path to be included. The files must originate from the same domain but may be located in a different folder.

A conditional directive beginning with an !#if directive must explicitly be terminated with an !#endif directive. Conditions support all basic logical operators. There are two possible scenarios: When an ad blocker encounters an !#if directive and no !#else directive, it will compile the code between !#if and !#endif directives only if the specified condition is true. If there is an !#else directive, the code between !#if and !#else will be compiled if the condition is true; otherwise, the code between !#else and !#endif will be compiled. nota Whitespaces matter. !#if is a valid directive, while !# if is not.

Blocking rules are not affected by this, but unblocking rules may cause problems. If a blocking rule is in one content blocker and an exception is in another, the exception will not work.

This is how it looks like for Base filter: &quot;filter&quot;: AdGuard Base filter, &quot;percent&quot;: 30, &quot;minPercent&quot;: 20, &quot;maxPercent&quot;: 40, &quot;strict&quot;: true  where: filter — filter identifierpercent — expected optimization percent ~= (rules count in optimized filter) / (rules count in original filter) * 100minPercent — lower bound of percent valuemaxPercent — upper bound of percent valuestrict — if percent &lt; minPercent OR percent &gt; maxPercent and strict mode is on then filter compilation should fail, otherwise original rules must be used In other words, percent is the &quot;compression level&quot;. For instance, for the Base filter it is configured to 40%. It means that optimization algorithm should strip 60% of rules. Eventually, here are the two versions of the Base filter for AdGuard Browser Extension: full: https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/chromium/filters/2.txtoptimized: https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/chromium/filters/2_optimized.txt If you want to add a rule which should not be removed at optimization use the NOT_OPTIMIZED hint: !+ NOT_OPTIMIZED ||example.org^  And this rule will not be optimized only for AdGuard for Android: !+ NOT_OPTIMIZED PLATFORM(android) ||example.org^  PLATFORM and NOT_PLATFORM hints​ Used to specify the platforms to apply the rules.

There are tools to assist you with that. You can use DevTools in Chrome and its analogs in other browsers but most AdGuard products provide another one — Filtering log. "},{"title":"Filtering log​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to create your own ad filters","url":"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#filtering-log","content":"Filtering log is an advanced tool that will be helpful mostly to filter developers. It lists all web requests that pass through AdGuard, gives you exhaustive information on each of them, offers multiple sorting options, and has other useful features. Depending on which AdGuard product you are using, Filtering log can be located in different places. In AdGuard for Windows, you can find it in the Ad Blocker tab or via the tray menuIn AdGuard for Mac, it is located in Settings → Advanced → Filtering logIn AdGuard for Android, you can find it under Statistics → Recent activity. Recent activity can also be accessed from the AssistantIn AdGuard Browser Extension, it is accessible from the Miscellaneous settings tab or by right-clicking the extension icon. Only Chromium- and Firefox-based web browsers show applied element hiding rules (including CSS, ExtCSS) and JS rules and scriptlets in their Filtering logs nota In AdGuard for iOS and AdGuard for Safari, Filtering log does not exist because of the way content blockers are implemented in Safari. AdGuard does not see the web requests and therefore cannot display them.

In order to do it without interacting with JavaScript directly, you can use a special debug style property. When ExtendedCss meets this property, it enables the debugging mode either for a single selector or for all selectors, depending on the debug value. Open the browser console while on a web page to see the timing statistics for selector(s) that were applied there. Debugging mode displays the following stats as object where each of the debugged selectors are keys, and value is an object with such properties: Always printed: selectorParsed — text of eventually parsed selectortimings — list of DOM nodes matched by the selector appliesCount — total number of times that the selector has been applied on the pageappliesTimings — time that it took to apply the selector on the page, for each of the instances that it has been applied (in milliseconds)meanTiming — mean time that it took to apply the selector on the pagestandardDeviation — standard deviationtimingsSum — total time it took to apply the selector on the page across all instances Printed only for remove pseudos: removed — flag to signal if elements were removed Printed if elements are not removed: matchedElements — list of DOM nodes matched by the selectorstyleApplied — parsed rule style declaration related to the selector Examples Debugging a single selector: When the value of the debug property is true, only information about this selector will be shown in the browser console. #$?#.banner { display: none; debug: true; }  Enabling global debug: When the value of the debug property is global, the console will display information about all extended CSS selectors that have matches on the current page, for all the rules from any of the enabled filters. #$?#.banner { display: none; debug: global; }  Testing extended selectors without AdGuard ExtendedCss can be executed on any page without using any AdGuard product. In order to do that you should copy and execute the following code in a browser console: !function(e,t,d){C=e.createElement(t),C.src=d,C.onload=function(){alert(&quot;ExtendedCss loaded successfully&quot;)},s=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],s?s.parentNode.insertBefore(C,s):(h=e.getElementsByTagName(&quot;head&quot;)[0],h.appendChild(C))}(document,&quot;script&quot;,&quot;https://AdguardTeam.github.io/ExtendedCss/extended-css.min.js&quot;);  Alternatively, install the ExtendedCssDebugger userscript. Now you can now use the ExtendedCss from global scope, and run its method query() as Document.querySelectorAll(). Examples const selector = 'div.block:has=(.header:matches-css(after, content: Ads))'; // array of HTMLElements matched the `selector` is to be returned ExtendedCss.query(selector);  "},{"title":"Debugging scriptlets​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to create your own ad filters","url":"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#debug-scriptlets","content":"If you are using AdGuard Browser Extension and want to debug a scriptlet or a trusted scriptlet rule, you can get additional information by opening the Filtering log.
